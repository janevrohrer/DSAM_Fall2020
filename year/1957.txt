Night. Everything falls flat
The dump of the world. Even within gravity,
the cold. There is a woman
playing piano we do not see color
for some space There were green trees, the country.
The houses were farminghouses. The phonograph, too
simple as a road. The ceiling is white
And somewhere now clouds leave the sky
Look at it, the keyboard's marking time
inside like a harp something
breakable, it's as if eternal
the thing drags out, had to be figured out
a long time back she remembers the tones
in FRance. There will be some years after this
after last year
she wears glasses
at least in giving a study, patience
echoes leaves, distantly
blocking the window
in the broad dark
at the muffed room

Do it yrself
Now they have two cars to clean
the front and back lawns
bloom in the drought
why not turn the other radio on the
pious hopes of the Red Sox
yes, that's a real gangling kid coming down the street
he’11 grow up
he'll fill out
sponges with
we got
-they are taller than
handles
trinaural hearing
their cars
