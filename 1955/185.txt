I n
The air charged heavy with
things by themselves
and together, the
spider conceived
as cubic machines
The strange childish beasts
threatened in self-removal
the jungle, and nearer the
ground
the insects
consciously hideous
gaped
the cat climbed up an automobile
and there were no birds
and I come back to
the bare field
of summer
