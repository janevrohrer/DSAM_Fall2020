green shrubs
the pipe of fountains, winter
light on walls
the boundless closes in
planes are brief
high up
they wait
for more sky
wind
at the land
a place with pots,
the big town
private houses
broad hospital windows
the distributive
the flight
brought in, no, victim
slice of mirror
when time may tell
the thread downstairs somewhere the
operating room
sacking hang out
afterwards
slept
nicely forgotten dream
over the desk the clock high
museum
and bed-size elevators
fire in hospitals, but never yet
tall ones the escape
patchwork
depiction of fields
Where I came to there were
a number beside me
mouth-colored
the charred dreams
battened stretches of roof
