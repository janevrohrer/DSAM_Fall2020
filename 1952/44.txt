Sunday
You look only in one direction
or on one side
But the city is around us
like the giant words taking so much space
streets at little angles
alleys, dividing the block
in the corner of the routes
down which the stories at once rise
driven by rain, the birds sing,
elongated recess, deadend square
looked over by substantial houses
which were fashionable, now more quiet
the tree growing as if outdoors
the curbing a shore they cross
cartracks and increasing traffic
to the pleasantly far walk
local varieties, the home of chocolates
welcome chancel-lots of garage
behind
modern slicks of industry
thousands of squares
the footbridge brace the great river
the famous field famous
for hit runs.
four hundred feet
is the equal of apartments
curving hospitals between
their older restful wings
Sometimes a foul reaches that height
straight from nothing rain
hurrying company!
for one moment drawing shape
the attic's infinitessimal distance
a single girl against the
clothing-store's wall
new by the front windows
in the out-of-the-way familiar suburb
half in sight of the bridge.
passes you rise
in like chutes viewing the street
then only paving then
the clotheslines of slums
before whole zones, yet
you're not in them,
lanes meeting the deck in the air
at them
you only look
above gastanks wharves railroads
wherever roads meet
Or down the sizable hill
up which the common trucks pull junk
with their irregular wooden bodies
the dark visitor
to one side
straining
