PIECE
Open the windows wide (half)
and go to bed
in the summer
with a breeze across your crippled behind
whether there is a moon or not
and the sea, some
(cover, for a time distance
and light
from a remainder of town
wherever it be
before the coast
the sun breaks out from it
The straight cracks of the ceiling
the shadow up on the fixture
and the glazed corners
in to the edge of dark
end the thoughtless or
crowded and figured days
followed by sleep
everywhere there is dirt
stones nearly
under these rooms
boards creaking
with no free of cellars
and birth, I was going to say
almost too much
were it only the morning,
death
ahead of us in particular
though some our lives have encompassed
the willow wept in his eyes
ham, lips as he
strummed
with the sun on it
for its own sake, and the
cutting clouds
which do not travel there
Going about under them
which you life sideways
as if iu thought, to walk, and
not like an animal
