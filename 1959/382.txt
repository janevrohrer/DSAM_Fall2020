religion, the attempt at communion,
baseball, clubs, sports, dancing
the gestures of a
practical way
allowing thought, the
energies of a fiction, carry
the business on, while you eat, and drink
suddenly the
holy water
which doesn't put you off
the quiet space
they even do it in
the open air?
with a mountain view
appropriating clouds
shifting like maps
of which I'm too much aware
while the horns sound for the way to
other engagements and busses
the stone wall a tenet
truck bodies
persisting, you set
in a paradox
with consequences
easily, yes
