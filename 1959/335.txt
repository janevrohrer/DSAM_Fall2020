storm
it's in fairyland that
things go around themselves
and without a spread here
there's always some forced in
another possible world
and the inch so lost paths
we're always just missing
the silent life
out by the trees earth spurting
wind, atmosphere
with the dead stream
we can't stand
always forgetting the sun such
efficient engine
difficult waste o the moon and the sea
stars
and the office furniture
all set for acoustics
the window making some smile
the dog's tail is alive
like the horses sleeping standing up
the way you move your bones
the well is empty
water moves up and down
day
shifts edges of sound
( fire
tears away rubbish and the dog sniffs it in
down the street in the sunlight
in the sunlight, the back seats
it always looks like new
the moment was strange
the bare shot branches
the flat-jacketed boys
the sun cloud changes
hydrant sides
wearing their knees
in the cold,
not their houses glassy
doored flames
down to the ground
nourishing dogs
rough
a local cloud strays out
freshened the hill without snow
a slant way from night, on
those branches where the roofs twist
leaves burrowing distance
