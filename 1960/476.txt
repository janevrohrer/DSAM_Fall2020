(Paris Rome Naples
bringing, against
a wall
yellow refreshment
by a cat
Maffia, to the
rescue
mount to the sun
canvas threads out
domes, attic of sails
will you retouch it?
the sun fades in
coming down
and going up
unknown,
a flagpole
a guitar does take the rise
to see that gigantic man
weep
when the future was broken
the human scale
was startling
the furniture
so over the dust of a hill
a street-lamp
or road, comedy of art
the guitar in memory
like a man, needs to sleep
a discreet noise
