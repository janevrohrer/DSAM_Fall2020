the fast life
schools under Brooklyn
the traffic jammed
final shattered air
:o flow on like a knife
lovely brick
o leafy fire
plowed
in the gable
birds
frightened
on the limbs
a fine view changing
park
zenith and depth
earth wasting like a sun
the zoo day
meshed grass
here (points
in time)
man-made
to circle in
with the brain
light edged green seats of
the control
the movies shot
in health the apple
borrowed on
trying to decide whether it's rain in the sealing beams
or snow
Initial
love
when you go out
the laned earth
missile imagination
blast of windows
a drop from the sky
flurrying a little
hundred tons
