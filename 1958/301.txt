BUT
the theory is practical the
transformation scene
is fantastic
dying is strange
a great imagination
to look at the thin-shored cloud
at the bottom of day
the unexpected flow
No conquest but the green isle
or comfortable city, with patches of wood
say, skies without god
provide sleep
to rearrange
a birth
where the dry trees are grown
and what would you give? land,
now you have ruled the depths
clouds complicated as stars
high in the air
like mountains, one in the middle
the
evening, because of the sun
above the swimmers, the beach
men
those free relations
mirror the moon in the west
ah, those bird-watchers
have a new object
Boston
hills
the sign of the earth
after a rain
colors November
the road curved
the road straightened
that coast lifted off
another brief shower
the earth seas
sound
history is tall
clouds Wd
clouds, the "dvln, aoors
the wind breaks on the
corner
the day in the house
