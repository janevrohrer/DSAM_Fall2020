the cat all wet
stepping around
the middle distance
enlarged
it's raining
over and over

Change of life? ah
the dark rain
against the dull trees
Living changes ah
the dark rain
against the dull trees

street
squeaks like a dumptruck
but itâ€™s a garbagetruck
taking things in
the new dog
very big
the huge hedge in the sun
block
watching clouds like
a trip in the mountains
over these hills
garden
slowly clouds
fill that
air
as birds go
close over
shadowy
increase
and I turn around

steam
piss
fire
trees
upwards
the stars
sparks

real
avid reading
I forget
above my head
so I talk through my hat
nobody knows what anyone's missing

garage doors
basketball
above
pingpong
for Bob
G and P

myriad streets
a
safe and sound
movie theater
foggy lights
blur on glass
due to rain
long factory rooms
the slope indoors
traffic
complex
ity
cantilevered
signs
do not
sway in the wind
force
a car trailer
smoke
moving abreast

long (macro)
traffic passing
the upper window
a hill slant
I was
onto Bob
half in the
basement room
sights
lowered
gusts enough
another day
to start out
steady
rattling
I'll never get
to math off far
as the dark is here
in under

a time it's whoop
chalked on
a spare tire cover
a straight flat strip

window washing
musical glass
