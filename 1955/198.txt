Afterwards
I should worry if the roof falls in;
until then give me some peace
It used to be that the heater might blow up
well, now I am the one who takes
the precautions against that
â€”the ones I used to take
puzzling, like
turning my back to it
me walking by one end
and the cat under the ladder
(somehow I have gone through life
without being kicked,
literally
in the meantime, let's be asleep
