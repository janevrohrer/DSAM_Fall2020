seaweed smells
in the breeze sewer-gas
blowed up the drugstore
injuring several that's what
the hospitals are for, with
quiet swards
50
unscathed
but shaken
to bear miracles
" the contents
at first taken for blood
so horror, so easily
arrived
from the day
so here come random eyeteeth
crashing out through the window like
bony fish
(yet the glass hurt
a faustian
flame by the soda fountain
and above the arena
where the circus's
3 rings go in
still banked with its
accessory porous world
tiers choked to the nooks of its sky
over the railroad station
