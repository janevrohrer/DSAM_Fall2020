Statuary
Graduates always smile
in the ads for Switzerland
bombers fly
over the game
heart
city
gods
everywhere
have shrines in narrow places
and the V-parade
worships the gone
Hod-carriers come in cars
to serve, slow time
centuries build
surveyed houses
slimmer than tudor
On the other side a
crisis is reported,
paradoxical
situation
that hasn't yet arrived
You can read it backwards
through set beginnings
A likely thing
there's no end.
