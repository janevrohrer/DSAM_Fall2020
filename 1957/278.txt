The Man-Eater
What gets printed
Ihe trivial things
make the 'fiction',
should be edited
we seem to have
And the news
found out.
Titles ideas etc.
Compulsive judgments
i Write my friends, ah, neglect of the weather
and the non-existent extent of the man next door
but in fiction I make it up
What I can do, reducing it all
down like the rain from huge clouds
if there were never floods
