the birds live, the 
monkeys from tree
to tree might run here the
scuddering fog
through the top branches
at the turn of the loop bay road
all
the remotely visible
all
trucks, stowage
in the sea,
windows facing the tanks
let it be beach cabins, let
the avenue
parades
on memorial day
and the birds drop
from a depth of houses
display be
uniforms
and the round-stippled drums
giant like rain
