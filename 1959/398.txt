at night the wind
fantasia
of the streets spluttering
sustenance close hard like heels
the moments are
a waste
fed by the day
and yet to continue walking on
the future,present and past
a horny flame
of earth, a tongue
shoulders
streams bawling
heads, your feet worn
as the stones
crest shell your pockets no guns
between legs
soap
the poor brutes"
also in the rain
in June
