Couple of Years
nowadays they call it a disaster
snow hilling the glass
a spectacle
landscape
topography, stuck
on the storm window pane, sifted
in masses like little hills
held out at a short distance
or the long-falling
shallow and cracked pieces of ice
like butting shaggy bears
or an animal fight
on all sides
the billboards deserted
which makes the deadening wind cry
(it is always a children's world
--then a day after
the snowball legs and battles
the fast sun
late slowing in spokes to fall
and there is gas for frying eggs
under all this
