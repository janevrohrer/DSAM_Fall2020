The Wave
There comes an end to 'entertainment'
but the self, the dilation, is
always coming back
I'm under those clouds for years, now,
and at moments I see them
in day, around supper when it's summer
or the afternoon
for what they are and for what they might be
it took some time to know
they are bigger than ocean liners,
also the shores they resemble,
or the sky, which seems
nothing without them
and then there's a small plane
that's always been outmoded
on the way past them tipping
that's how it operates
