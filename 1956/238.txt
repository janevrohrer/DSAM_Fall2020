after all the singing faces, you
with your mouths out of sight
as i respond
Where are your purposes you have kept
childhood in your hearts
each day, and the sky was blue
the sea was a waste
and you have come back again and again
with the years you were able to
come from a great distance
Today my brothers were here;
now at night there is you
myself under the sheets
But I grow old
because I was too much a child
