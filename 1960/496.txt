the big
car black shooting
towards the middle of the road
the reflections the straight sides swerved
deserted, couple of
hours
bright not
far away
the garden
to patches
recent angles encroachments
give it away
space mingled
ebb of leaves
the covering sky against
the evident 
shifts on the ground
old
rough as 
all the animals
to pass 
accentuated bodies
extreme insides, back to
wind making the 
trees sound 
in growing
put forth 
tongue project
birds only to
clear the air
shut in 
the car to 
drive
