Place just right
when i came to the last milestone — imagine
stone—It said
1620
America has died out
on Its endless highways
experience piled up
fast
here we have the
tor one man
life of Faure
every
which way, the mirror
and the world, clockwise...
for with that there's an opposite
for relief for a spell
and the roads become wider
or lead us over the 2nd stories
a child's body, smooth
and squirming from its excess
mind, simple and not knowing
speeded, the mounted edge
all the slums grown factories
long woods of beer, cognac and rye
and
all
there was the usual crowd
sorts of builds, different
looking like all the world
and you couldn't imagine
the multiple space
endless
as others were out of sight
and there was an old-type ship
"medieval"as some had it
possibly with ratholes, the
universe might be profound
every man's vessel (again ) his home
