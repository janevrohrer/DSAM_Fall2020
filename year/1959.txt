getting old
poems about
fences and vines
on earth, while the sky
holds the quiet
fantastic dimensions
masses and bits
through which the sun might glare
the attempt at standing still
to show nothing is worth
the final deliberations
the motors and
islands
scattered to infinity
we had a thunderstorm here yesterday and
today's expected again
pleasant
In August the leaves turn out
to a slow wind

THE WANDERING MOSQUITO
into my face
among the masses
When does he go to sleep
I forget he's irregular
Is there any sleep,at all,for him,
before death?
he wanders miles and miles and
becomes aware of the window
where the moon is
in a short time
the peg-board
and it's raining outside
94 humid
he hasn't hurt me yet
I have to open the window
his head is a constant drop of blood

illuminated birds
the Persian dark
ness in the light of
middle ages Insight is
walking back and forth
ah, now, the couplings
the imagination
scuffles
WHERE are the
five french hens
O pioneer

down the street in the sunlight
in the sunlight, the back seats
it always looks like new
the moment was strange
the bare shot branches
the flat-jacketed boys
the sun cloud changes
hydrant sides
wearing their knees
in the cold,
not their houses glassy
doored flames
down to the ground
nourishing dogs
rough
a local cloud strays out
freshened the hill without snow
a slant way from night, on
those branches where the roofs twist
leaves burrowing distance

memory of sound
Instantaneous
patch of landscape
how can your little finger
bring up dirt
ingots
hunger
the sparrows there for the gulls
the sea out on its plain
the sun crosses my view

horse
hours with his navel
funny thing
how
we return to the sky
or earth
wings

Plenty of time
but I can't sleep nights
Life is static after all
nothing before a man but a woman
the kaleidoscope of
sheep on a stone wall
the mails are unimportant
the poles
running through infinity
rain spindle the sun
they hop keep your eyes on
them
they
form themselves into waves
numbers
and disappear
They were going nowhere
but it takes time
no good,now to find
the heart beat
suddenly the window seems washed
the newspapers falling in the
opposite bathroom
I'm right in the reflection
permanent
radio ads
the clarity distant from gravel
the meadow dying

The paradox of
the Invisible
once visible
my painful
mystery
heading out
the sun
rayon
not here moving, but bent
a river
with ducks curves
and floats
welcome that
appearance
the whole is divided as you look
and know well enough
gleaming in front of the black
bound to imagine
how
in sleep it is no strain
poems
of the subdued trees
the huge depths
may be easy death
soundless no doubt
shaken by morning light
easily
to enhance itself
with afternoon
stars
and sea air
Water of the flat hood
night on the moon

the snarl of rain cars
the people are trivial
and try to go back and forth
to treat each other
sit with the windshield wipers
with all the lightning
while the rain brings close its summer smell
boundless over the trees
gulls raising their wings up through it
bulb of their furling cry

How many times, death
has cried
wolf the
cloud
larger than the bay
the ceiling disappears

the music
in air
the bows, trumpets
moved
and the red sunset
out
by the window

LETTER FOR DUNCAN
just because I forget
to perch different ways
the fish
go monotonous
the
sodden hulks of the trees
in a glorious summer
you don't realize
how mature you get
at 21
but you look back
wherever a summer
continue 70 seasons
this one
has been so various
was the spring hot?
every habit
to read
nothing you've done you have
older
the fish
can't bother screaming
flap by hook
the working pain
jaws by trying a head bodies
you'll always go to sleep
more times than you'll wake

gable
The sun and stars
part of the world
a rain
glazed roof
you look out
clouds
about the shape of yesterday
insubstantial
coast
aisle
even after snow, in the cold
where you find them
any animal
grown roots
the
sky exchange of its lids
evening bald
plungers
baying
depths of the land
submerged
a queer
underground
surfacing
towards dead inchoate
fish damp snake
reeds climb
slope
swum by an illusion of a waterfall
borne in
to the country grains
the wave crag
permeated life
slamming up
the imagination
is in the mouth
oceans
tide
unceasing continual
pitches hospitals
the eye sweeps
far out
how much of the earth

wings fluttering up near the
beginning of rain
I like to see
the pink car wet
wheels matched by a pool
the rain
muddy in sound
imagine it tipped
besides what it is both
semicircles
steep the gutter
the light water
as much as you look to see
houses which are the same
double barrel
the passion for cars gone
the present as quick as showers
and the past
fallen
a rainbow maybe
somewhat behind trees
enough years

gutter
toe bigger tonight
dependent on
how you put it
the room being an old one
now
these rooms, and their clothes
closets
reeling, winter, fish on the
porch
end clouding to get wet
shelves
The clock's moving
at a nice speed
in the circle of things
the amplifier, silence

embrace of two flies
on my knuckle
the wings rattling
ears
it isn't the season
the radio
cans
the musty-
lighted
world
in the afternoon
trees the wind
touched by cloud
field , in the same space
summer, again
ordinary
it will have to sicken

a thing about
a plane pulling a sling
letters but how did I
get it down
on paper
below the public
prints on wheels
they deliver the good
which smells
and the miles lie quiet
you can't lower an equation without
resort to zero
What's past?
Let the runway
stop here the old corn grows
invisible mostly
remote
in the sound of people
bathing by a lake
clouds

Emptiness, house, the wind
a mere buffer in the trees
not just a sound, exercise stripped
for another
seasonal attempt the clouds have moved off
the sky is blue ravines
alter behind the branches this is what they have been waiting
for
unconsciously
it is lasting all day
What
are birds for?
rivers
to the crotches cliffs
ocean drops turbulent the dying
leaves, the street which
one night, will escape ridden
cover the seeds, how
can they take on
the broad dance,
the numb bark, wild,
the wind streams on

These are the
winners of the game motorcycles
him ahead she looking
behind
the wind in lids
a town clouds clear under
fresh morning
a ride through noon transmute forever
the seasoned old dr.
who exuded the hard human
breath legacy of latin
from the chair usual organs the brief
wounds of the still young out on the field
in a slouch
the season of winners and
everyday hoo-ray for
ribboned school lean out the windows to
beachwagon pound, as long as you pass
ivory
shocked cars the indians, coming
going with
the secret clearings of
moments that are hidden
by trees, ramifications
deepening leaves when they
beat the bleachers at the
ultimate reading
ravines
felt downward by the squirrel
saturday
the concentration of spectators
blowing their horns, nose, to extend
the band or something, beyond the
ninth choral wave
they made, though the band, at the same time
drums out, like the soldiers they are
like
the siren air raid test
topping if off, become
a feature doom Saturdays an
open city
as the young scatter
and horns again some reason near
sunset

Face
under
him
the bed
the table
a chair
through
crawling
flight
around
flat
crowded
safe
working

the rain
rank draping bale
radios of the world even the
tall buildings from a distance under our
dust covers capacitors
along stone the
industry cloudy roofs
with washline days balls
have peaked the 4th floor and
accelerated the negative
furnitures sections of the sidewalk
the shorefront a few
streets over arias
cathedral a separate pocket
actually, in the other direction
,towering
arches with trees, ivy
to the middle of
country boughs, the wind
wades and the rain
down importunate as a
cat
hanging out magnificent
coal slides and sooty
arms of the burners drams
chipped rims of the basement wells
steaming to the jungle
erect brassed through the bedrooms and
office labelled panes as the
water flushes down behind a
dentist ranged with the
sheriff the
public staircase insurance
behind doors standing
open in hot weather inside
where a cat emerges
who scrabbled the windows mineral
water the
sort of escalator he, suddenly
is, beyond the
narrows geranium grill
like the
trellis we've platted out
woodwards advancing the
old orchard view the mind
not refinable
from the kitchen where
faggots are not housed 
splinters in the rain
or high sun
that sound,
a real autumn in gusts
to dispose of summer
leaves

t o c c
how read it
line after line
given
one look
refresh the eyes
against the abyss

blast blueness mouth with the sky
time spread the mind
car
clouds raised as if
mute passed
away from the room in houses and
the child
long sun as it
shows the sea also
the branches fewer now
slowly forgotten for a
rising again rustle
color of trees

the discursive how
packed
lives
and by the echo
dissolved
as the
forcing together
a pile of screens
you could leave acquire
time, flies
reverberating
the dark house, and the vast
sun moving, out,
slowness, level of it all
approach night
the clouds to the sea
stirred on

Again dawn
the sky dropped
its invisible whiteness
we saw pass out
nowhere
empty the blue
stars
our summer
on the ground
like last night another
time
in fragments

Islands
My backyard the stars that
wind should be hard at the corner
nightly the lavish bed
taking me nowhere how
I grew up thinking with time
that doesn't the sky
deserted, dark, made the oceans
cold, the sand
damp, hard many dawns have flushed up
and the coast has a road at the
houses turned over boats
which may be narrower than
when they ride out in the bay
and further still into
the quiet, nearly equal
on both sides the nets
and the shaded map of the cliff
elsewhere
beginning to sleep
the cricket drills
constant in the field

past self
and the present
window with
a back yard
life on the wall
birds
flight
doubling,
pecks at the barrels
after the dog like shadows
I
step to a western saloon
with some nice glass

sleepless a week but
windy last night
nothing to do
with the arms wrestling
trees reel
to block the whistle
The shine was on the beech
and the sun is beyond in the sky

An Imitation
(a shot of Rbt Creeley)
What has that face got to do with that
poetry? In
order to have one you need the other, yes
the sky
would do as well I know
Questions are funny, a flower
of life then Let's
go on What are the leaves
in back What's
the sky doing in your head? The
photos of some of your
"predecessors" What
has your voice to do with
the thoughts which at least pass
in my own life, its
hurry
While the churches
are open as the earth There are statues •
in all the museums and
around them now in the park and
even in the wilds
again
and paintings of stars, nights,
in walls
opposite mirrors

Shafts
a wind
hardly
to listen to
denotes a river
play on
footsteps
material
gapping
woods cloud over
white in the sky
sunny decembers also
and the close months
cliffs
stony perhaps
in the bay
where life too is a wall
there will be ice, and melt
even in descent, or
of course re-frame
the gutters dirty with grit
where the girls took any direction
lodged fins or eyes
actually feathers heads maybe
or arrows
slopes room for all
particles
outlines

A glass
of water
complexate
waves
outdoors
broken
bottom pitch all that left
of vacuous sand
and cut off a sharpened
edged core crawling there
things
the uneven section
sun
baked
cold underground
water is everywhere
enough to be solid
where a tuft even
hangs in it and then the deep vessels
ride sea sprouts there
is a table
broken
into

before dying
crosses his toes
at will
or then in the morning again
the sun up
slowly
it wasn't the time
and the unspeakable leaves
remaining
slowly is the way
time absolute
you speed up
it does not dissolve
the stomach takes
the punishment
or it's durable
small bones in the head
a death
to memory
