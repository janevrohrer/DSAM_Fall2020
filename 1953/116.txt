The sky,
and trees like
wind
the trees full of wind
steep and continuing
posts mute in themselves
and conches turned lamp horns
might belong to the houses
shouldering runners which
all ways go straight
And the last colorless leaves
tearing as in
a gauche direction
the same as those first, perhaps,
where the Spring is
The lyre
as the forests making
themselves
direction
joints
between quarters
only squirrels (not even the cats
or some men, do
have business up such grades
stillness it may be
of one kind and
another
