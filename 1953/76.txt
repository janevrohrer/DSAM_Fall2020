and the squirrel
jerked behind the tree
Once I could catch only the movements
then the face, bigger than it was
area gone
and yet the tail
both sides
and the animal in the background
batting his head, crazy
which means: he was eating
thing ugly and beautiful
holding his lavish bolt
like the bridge most of him
complete pride
and the glide hobble
his green prison
stopped led on
his unbelievable want
crossing the road
straight
and he does not know
he does not know
lightning
the ground quickly as trees
and eventually running in circles
