THE LONE STATE
It's saddening to see
the break-up of life
What is a big plane?
then there is sitting still
with all the unseen things
♦♦ movie shadow in the sun
Giant ♦♦
the old men
baffled and
shaken
on the way to their assumptions
the sky, earth
dust, or
the frivolous lace, or
history
the strong nursery light
above the long seat, swimming
without a hole the
rippling oils
of the battle
pound
in the well crooked street
the glass
empty in the window
against the country
sunset
over with
the seasons merged
In the respirating earth
variously prone
