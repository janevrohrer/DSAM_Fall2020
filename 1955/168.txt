File
while not setting me back have thrown me forward
the wide shield, the screen
along the Fels, the willows
at that season
perfect i can remember
the tiles
start a region of Africa
park
hills
still by the clock
the laid square
the tree around in the movie
the roofless eaves
and come in after the store-front
fluorescent
the red, spines in the play
when a child
gas on the peninsula
where the sea
not visible
but at night
(i still make a distinction, the tree in the snapshot
may be the apple then in the morning
sleep naked when there is no light
blocked by the kitchen boards
