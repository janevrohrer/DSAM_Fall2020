root
beer the good
19 century the American
War crickets
at the night the station
of the sea
the difference the field too is
out near the window going
summer like a train
off futures round to the earth
as a plane a toy
childhood at will
winter makes a light room
the sound
losing itself in plain
woods we might
raise ourselves over
to ride down in the leafy hills
of color the whole
seasons
the whiteness balancing
even with lost memories the
remoteness the spring and the fall
send forth leaves
you didn't think of circles
many the horizon
or zenith not a cup
the bowl of forests,close
rabbits and the fit claws
of birds
a squirrel wanders
back streets
directly in mind the world
has long poles
power like a loop of hills
for an uninterrupted sled
the outlines that yawn
fish live with each wave
keep your eyes when you come an
opening ground
