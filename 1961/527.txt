suddenly the grave
pits blank of the night
now there's the peeling stores
Food! Food! beside
where the sun, sightless, went down
the radiance plunge tires
behind branches straggling
behind walls , grills
absence of snow
to melt to spring
stains of a climate
the sky changes
without clouds
graveyard loses itself off
the block to the back door
plumbing ocean supplies
the wind glance of a road
