Don Waynor in a Bechuanaland
you're friendly with the cats
as I am, more often than you
I can be friendly too
this is friendship, not because
we need each other
but we are together
The village idiot was a farce
like other people the timeless fool
in the middle of the wind
Lear, keeping his tone
I wonder how many
have faked that
I don't know how long you'll be here
you look like you'll live forever
