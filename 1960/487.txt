Branches
the pleasantries of my skin
toe breaking the wind
the islands
upward, in the sky
resolved from
the slant earth
the big places
carrying long bays
turned straight, a mirror
the diver
like stars
become endless blades
where the ice heals
the car plunged
it was a slippery
road
my palms would like
eternity
