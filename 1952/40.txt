The Daring Young Man
on His Back
It's all a waste of time; pain is
And satisfaction's preferable
But let me on that level spend it freely
On the high plane why should boredom develop?
It's happened many times. I should know better
Enjoy nothing, the absence of trouble
Somethere is there, but only unexpected
Nothing was useless
that I can remember
I do as I please, going from here to there
(The farther I go, the better it may be
