To Speak of
few human relations
though the linen and towels
on the reel, with the
wobbling wind under them
silent and unfelt
while to step out,through the porch
and go on
the indefinite morning
lifted,in the present again,
the absolute is a problem
and the joint of the room ,
shingles, around which
it is invisible
but room
a morning and night
and the kitchens next door
in the sun
the clarinet above us
like rock
of some wind
