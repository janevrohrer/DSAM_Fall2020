When All Sleep
When the sun is sinking
And the moon comes out.
All the little fairies
Go hopping all about
When the moon is shining
When in bed I stay;
All the fairies show themselves
And all at once they say,
"Let us dance together
And let us play a tune
Beneath the little twinkling stars
Beneath the silvery moon."
