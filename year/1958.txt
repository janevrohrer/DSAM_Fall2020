all these long cars
legal on the black roads
a more certain speed
here's mercury again
a mile of stone houses ,
the sea screens the beach
leaves at the top
hill trees
birds flock
we'll never remain
by the coal lighthouse
Let's take to our boats
and crickets' shoes
all kinds
protuberating
snaky
series

clouds complicated as stars
high in the air
like mountains, one in the middle
the
evening, because of the sun
above the swimmers, the beach
men
those free relations
mirror the moon in the west
ah, those bird-watchers
have a new object
Boston
hills
the sign of the earth
after a rain
colors November
the road curved
the road straightened
that coast lifted off
another brief shower
the earth seas
sound
history is tall
clouds the lost space
clouds, the moving doors
the wind breaks on the corner
the day in the house

The old papers
in the old mailbox
before they're delivered
the old houses
are all right
the grahndstahnd at
Wonderlahnd
pilate's daughter
we go again around the pylon
the splendid fuel
tank up
inquisitive dog
a jumping boy
flat on the wind
ok
the baby's soon grown
tenement slice
the railroad bridge is
who would think of coating it
the radio billboard
which is an ad
same as the street

as if blindness, the sun
sudden back of the house, every day
the moment the world gets so strange
leaves distantly blocking the window
in
cars behind them
creep under them
parade memorial
up against the hill
after the drilling continues
air dance on the street

the far bliss home
in the risen sun, the country
the stream like a serpent, or fish
to go down
the harbor teeming
with broad flats but then
the horizon
trailing back
the merrygoround in the park
away from the slips
the horn goes off to the piccolo
the thunder mists
moving up a course
