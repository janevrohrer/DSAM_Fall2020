a vigor the plane is over
a moment
wide houses as when
the offhand
bodying passage heads
noose from the back a chair
surrounding delible walls
of the air a
Storm blows lightning
steam pavement the train you can see
across country 
like barns
there are drops behind
big spheres there are such
spaces by
a pig's ear
the sky quiet
or peas
you shift
practice
hop
a table to lean holes
between the legs 
the bedposts
rightside down
contracting the floor
and beyond the ruqs
cellar clear the chimney 
you thought as you come 
. ynn as von r,
in a sea-crowd day
the sheer smoke the space
that gulfs the wood vault 
the cast beds of the station
bats fluttering wind hanging
bark of the banging
like tobacco in the
currents
like a plane
crowds on and a cat
may follow so many
blind boxes
