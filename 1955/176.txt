U p
in the vague field of the sky
a track a moment visible
man opened
his world himself
himself and the world
the sea
horizon lost
farther away
across it
the white trace
I realize the sun
by moments my eyes
bombarded, as yet
my other selves
And against any color
the black speed hidden
the other stars are pointed
in twilight
