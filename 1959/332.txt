open air where
fire alight
in the other window as it
reflects
the boy pushes the balloon
against the cottage and it
lights up
my mother has moved the furniture around
again, an accomplished fact
the horizon broken at any points
within it
and blocked up the windows after
narrow, releasing
all the upholstery smells, since
winter demands its change.
ah clothing, after i had seen
how branches spread leaves across
one tree, glass, the
opposite to recession
now it is hard times
my mother has made herself
the kept chairs
in the past
the cottage is thin. but remains
while the cars
again, looking
up, departing,
for exercise
the drivers
(for the eyes) (after that
friend's house )
and getting killed
That the neighborhood might be covered
by one roof, occurred
this morning, Snow on the ground
phonepoles, flagpoles,
windows, so many chimneys,
even up the hill
grass smoking out west
the tides, clouds from the past
vanishing rain
the base
beaten out,
death when you don't want it what you like
is a plain object
the long-trunked clouds
a weltered event
shale fish broken off
a spiderweb hitched the dictionary
overnight, I left it out there, well
screens in summer to keep the flies out
into the dark sea
the open garage doors
under the vine which in autumn
looks as if it still might hold
shingles, encroached saw, horses
somebody's back yard
angling out
you want the hills to rise
twigs
levelled on against the sky
After 3 days the air
empty from the rain
