Drive
under the cigarette lap
trees
the poster moving on the
truck
boy and girl or
and the insects
shearage
somewhere bright
Til txps
cash
hill
house
horrible streets
those slipstack faces
take it for all in all
I slid the drawer in and out under the
trombone the
butterfly radio
don't like this costume
fat
habit
course the precieuse opera
everyday
changes
or else something
musters water
Le silence de ces espaces Ã©ternel
capable all sorts of
detours and reaction
tails
rounded by the mostly
cold sky
hard
roots
the wind breaking light in the trees
