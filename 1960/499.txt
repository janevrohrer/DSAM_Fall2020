break the dogfight
the lawnmower too
up
the rollercoaster
as the lark flew
the field plane
3 sudden sky
you hold in distinction
roots grow
into a blade or stalk
the railway
the children
grimed precision
who will
be men
the crickets
do not keep me
from nothing
the afternoon has many hours
Passengers take the air
the shut deck
ss if looking through the sea
the rattle of boats and
the great clock figure
a spire
rides over
(the inrolled
maps in the sky
the parishes
the sea
is turned up
and fed
