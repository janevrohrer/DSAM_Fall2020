Road-side
The wind with trees makes lightning
and from clouds it makes thunder,
though not those
Instruments penetrate, not through the bushes.
In some hidden street
while the world is flying, the maps
topography changes, inch
relax sound relax sound
under those contours
Sometimes the raised figures
deepen
and clash, wandering
to become pools or old nations
And this is the calm world
from a distance
Indian-open smoke
And these are greeks
both northern and southern imaginations
which are quiet and magnificent things
And never see stone
or North heralds
this isn't history
But, for some minutes, wing
moving at length
crag
the boulder eye-pieces
in the islanded edge
trailing the tip
such silent drivers will never exist
