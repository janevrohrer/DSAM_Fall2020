Apples in the October wind
have become blossoms
and pears towards the windows
give a certain comfort
The background is
radiant light, tree-heads
shift recessions: boughs
toss through approximate regions
upward, violent gaiety
deep bays and bays with fruit,
not rained-on but drowned
by the going-away sun,
piled in the wind,
season's onset
Apples But pears point
towards Euclid and air
for quieter elements
