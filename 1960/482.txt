Desperately 
to act
the unreal
the difficult
roll 
stand away
and deliver
the law 
on one leg 
the spirit 
turns green
to the surface
leaves fan
the river sap
let us drink
the rain
falling disparate
speak in the ai]
together at
the horizon
the dripping
taste of time
no city
but earth
pavement
man
or woman
and
silence
does not crowd
