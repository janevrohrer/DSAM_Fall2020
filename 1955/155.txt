The strange Land
Resting earth I feel
the different wind blowing
the branches I could see
with the barest leaves
the stars and woods move
and some weight comes down
the separate trunks
cast tunnels lying plain
below the heads
whose shapes stretch and
spring by the air.
towards the corners rail
shadows, the old houses
the busses of perfection
in the night deriving people
continue and some mount up
at stops from muddy entanglements
off buildings with empty windows
where the sun will arm itself
tomorrow momentarily
the useful drawers agape
while tonight there might be an owl
round some newly done back yard
