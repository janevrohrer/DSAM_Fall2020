BE SILENT
with the verse
turning
the world
looks like a hurricane
the curtain falls
the strong flood of the wind
feeling sound
won't circle
with me
the door seems neglected
an intermittent dog
he'll be able to lie down
today it was hot
the trees rank in the night
what a thing to think of
the moon
an unfamiliar place
giant
late in October
I wouldn't want to be
frightened by the sun
