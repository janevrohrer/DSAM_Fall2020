The Party in the Fields
broken mirror of the landscape
even to the sky
men of the definite movement
a part of the river
it was an ideal climate, and
it's too bad
they can't die
like the sun goes down
young
but, anyway, you have to leave it
if you go on in living
but, there are different
kinds of natures
I like my friend's house
with the driftwood picked up
near there, right on the beach I'd think it was
two steps down
there
almost resembling something
on the wall
