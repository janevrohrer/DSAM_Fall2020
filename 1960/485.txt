the steep town
part through hills
split day
season
with a gun
the tree shock
a lane
and the field a hospital
efficiently into the air
the heat
passes and
has come again
the beating down
of the quieting
insect
oo more towers
a prostrate eye
terrors may
be in the sky
night's wet
level
stalks
pressed row of pain
a safe high
part inside
displaces
the shambles
nice
shelving of earth
plates
the ships
of the surface
and flags
