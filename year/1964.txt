one died by this tremendous headache
drowning in laughter
the tv was a gas
some kind of vacation in the wards
then many went down and voted
the whole year round
stars frosty or something
wonderful view
at the edge of your seat
the moon off
polluted waters
degrees merge
miles
clear Sunday
the one-round fight
everybody watched
they had expectations
chew it , it
can drop
tomorrow morning
romance of the moon
across curtain, strings
plaster different from panes
an even coat of paint
just outside
scaffold flutes on the sill
?
you like to come down and watch
the gym
with the sick men
I know what it's like
not to get dizzy looking down
the painter comes through the window
to paint
the doorknob

the earth you may as well
sit with a foot on the roof
imagine how rain in the rain
brief music can be
piano open as
eye the sun
never going off
or different times different
music of water
as the snow melts
carried through the mountain
the sun has made it white
your bowstring avoids the steeple, it
stands clear, as the moon
at night in crowds
your body spread down before
clouds
a gradual loosening
where the greater hill rises
hard as your eyes belly
cold houses as in heaven
round around warm lights
upside down
encroach the sky
tree disproportionate
bush flower standing
in front of your knee you
ride behind the other
the broad accessory tapping
rain on the roof nothing
inside that could be mistaken
the clouds are light
holding nothing but mist
in the deepening sky I
would imagine it's
the single-roomed house you've lived in
flowers
passing on, white

Futility,
a voice
or wind
high up
bushes
branches and then cloud
leaves
in memory,the past
towards its riverbed
the back of the head, turn
the neck
part of the horizon
the river bends
the bed its
deep down
sun again
on the rocks ages
a thing formed by life perhaps
intensification of years
events must take a place a certain size
print into death
tensed life
as in memory
the gray is the green
you can look
straight at the sky
shadowy bird
doesn't stop at the tree but goes across
the road
wind
gathered water
moments grow each direction

it's a windy day
with the lions
among the tossed hills

the shade leaf
inside
like a bird
over the edge
a flight partly through the glass
on the window it
fades with the sun
a cloud coming
into view
slower than the wind
where it foots the vine

I am here
parked riding the hill up my feet
on the back of the front seat

a window in darkness
the baby cries in
the next house this
is a neighborhood
I can't do a thing
dogs are quiet

bird music
we live in the country
when we shut our eyes

In a corner of my window
when I lean over the
moon
going away

with enough breeze
the sea
echo of night
more gulls
the sun caught
above the tree robins
singing
adjacent parts

the sound
sea through the horizon
under the stand of trees
it comes by on the wind
flat and round
earth and sky

only the
renews it
thought
touching
distance
a
we
shall overcome
the sunset
leaves are borne by branches make
all ways sunlight or moonlight
nothing the motionless
to recognize charge the strip of sun
worldwide
through the stars
from east to west silent
types of water
animal in places or time
is not strained
state
from a faucet neither
underground sound
is towards the horizon
of nature ) birds
singing
time of day
a bush
but then on the wing
they cry
eager enough
to use our eyes
in love
a far blue wall
or tangent
no billboards
in the sky, we may walk
the limits of jobs, not too much
listening, sing
somewhat, learn
what to do with ourselves

motion unperceived thought
that the visible should be
this sun standing water as
stretching the lawn
day really endless time
would change broad air
the branches turning the hulls
condense the docks
far away stir of waves
makes light you hear
cut sound from
the other afternoons
so drowned
and
all sleeping may be a mood

what damp paper
wood foggy day
rain countering glass
little
wind
brought on down
articulate
equally, the sea
may sound in leaves

Sunday
with clouds
a few shadows

Time goes where
is light as
I shut my ears
try and turn years
the radio
comes
blind
have
eyes the made event
brought further some
notable step
again again
turned
off able to
fight sound with sound
when the others aren't quiet
they give you
the means thought goes
after speech high
lobe the weather
advancing a turn too much
words conversion
to look at cloud ring
or blue long day
side pockets
in beyond horizons
a twig sweeps
the sky
as the wind constantly fades
moonlight comes and
bathes trees
the sea sounds
river open
tunnelings
beautiful
storm clouds,
the sun
shines underneath

Listening to stone (s)
If there is silence it's
a long way out
and through
pool the
disturbed
broken flies too
into the air back
the sea becomes
a truck at dawn

to see the ocean
peace and quiet in the sky
drown view of the city
you imagine the reach of noise
the expanse to hear the sound
the sea echoes wind
long against man
and through the streets salestalk
precise, acoustics
glass glass gas gas
coloring eyes
a system of motion
darkness blowing a wall
cracked in most cases
foam stars
as in the air as
under wheels
of feet
as leaves still growing in
fewer millions
imagination eating
time like a body
mountains on water
wave over and over
vivid on gray
striding streets at
once all that looms
if you find time
you think
if a few things
merge, you may sleep

to open your ears
real music
on the wire sparrows
or any other birds
sit still
their world dimensional
more than dogs or cats
or perhaps men
and listen
a moment of stillness
stick in the ear
a beginning and origin
attachment
of flight
before the sea's exertion
to trace the appearing moon
or stormy as it may be
an afternoon rain
how long it can seem to last
I think it's over there
the sky through the trees
I recall passing through them, many
branches and leaves too
begin time
is present
the moon increases night
water sparingly
a new fathom
a table crickets
unendingly surface
the field out back
different tympanum
I imagine it shining

spring smell
of a spray among
autumn fires
the dog
a leaf up his behind
stops barking
and enters the wet

angelic youth
found home
the stepwise leaves
finally rattle
days follow days
raking slight wing
morning the sun rises
brick corners the evergreen pool
you see a mirror through glass
sky half
up the staircase
the other way
the trees sound of a river
birds still hold
while the river bends
visible from the plane
fuming
continues after takeoff
almost a bird answering the dog

Small, flightless birds
the voice far, tinkling bells
museum
of sorts the rats destroyed
moving ashore, Midway
slow is flat wall of the sea
the
poem and sky
each island
rose
farther than any whale
fins
breathing above the waves
the mirrors
heat
past sunshine
vibrations of air
spiders, then birds, settle
reflexive
man
bringing what he can
interest
in
the quickening run-through
one thing at a time
tides, a large motion
small waves give boats
menageries
from the bottom
rock crumbles to earth
under rain
the seas
clouds mulct the moon
flats
the whale is still hunted
in certain parts
prodigal
the deep light

steam from the rim of a plate
for easy eyes
the spent fire
the sun shines on clouds
or it keeps raining today
lakes, rivers and seas
awareness of fractions

"Christina's World"
a skyline, red barns
are business
a field of oats
the head and the body
