Position of Ease
Now I will do it, I said,
springing from that dream
and how much has it happened
in space, grasping, out in the air
by those trees, the shadow, each with its spot, really
shaking down,in the brightness
was I there
What grownup has fastened them, then, like mountains?
Travel,
climb of the summer leaves
in the beats of rain that refresh them
under which they still float
bending,
unseasonable winds
vivifying them
in their spasmodic journeys of wind
no passage
access
inaccessible
Admitted clocks need not be heard
who disappears into those growths

still is, a crash, that was
in the deep back yard alley
lawns, netfenced, hedged,
stooped, and a short parallel
only heard
street
intervening
held, past, otherwise, so,
in the arena a
beast from a soundtrack
might have been advertisement
at that hour
by the gas-pumps
0 sound) there life
echoing
the neat concourse
you can only mark out
by not moving
an inch, not moving
the mind
Unhurt I imagined, the car continued
10:4-10:4 1/4
treads railing the sudden cast
whereas once I would like to have seen it
denying it
such as rollercoasters' ragged ends
always glanced, or with less holes
flashed, struck in the news
now I have been honest I am retired
tilt back
still at a point of safety

silent
though History doesn't repeat
the night, I think, coming
just now
each of these years
lights from that faraway window
and will, again,
nearly enough
by this door
and everywhere, on the other hand, I pose
at one march
and raising with fractional
another one
darting
the same,partially
eyes cover
If the grass does not vary
or if building is thrown together
how is it
areas, smothering bloom
in the dark parted like branches

Those atmospheres are far away,
and surprise mountains widen close
as the sun turns and flights are lost
Towards the positions of the poles
Like the body of land I would like to die.
This inclination of the cold
and lamp, the slope becoming fainter
Night facing outward end to end
those quieter stars, mild or severe,
show unroomed passes where they stay
and touch the dark through background doors
Past hearts and flowers neighborhood
Autumn histories
story rains.
no
they do NOT come straight, no, they shake
off, much as the beams
which they may be said to have stripped, which still gale,
still figured, the air
waver
A long time I strained, watching
what I took for walls, nevertheless
Do not let this speed fool you
It may be perfection is exclusive,
its own season,
naked,
an Alice moon
though killing time is killing ourselves
The radio warns the motorist
speech from the middle of a room
but blind from a stationary point
twenty-five minutes to go but
New Years
he hurtles towards his Square
Prepare for transitory hands
some stars have moved, later
In the shifting fogs, the stage bound hulls
fast, colonnade
