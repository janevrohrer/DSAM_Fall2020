DIM VALLEY
a long time
and where the future is
a near thing, or distant
over a hill
you must turn underground
branches like leaves
whirling inwards
dark
which can go
the storms are over
the perfect room
subtle as it was
light and
God's shadows
ranging their own wood
there is no bottom but hole
bunkers and
just indoors
the covered plain
and other rivers
eyes at cornices
flat
the animals , come
fixed, driving
all slope differently
between the guns and
hoped bombs
narrow hiding
they rocked at the sky
up stairs
where spring was.
past the stove and
beds
through the bends of a tree grown
independently
the usual city
