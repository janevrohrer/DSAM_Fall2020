Settling out setting out
roadways

what you’ve done
all those positions aims junction

on the wall or edge of
pandemonium
spreads peace with
certain fingers
since he sees such fingers with
upholding them
level and open gaze
and we can watch
a circuit is made there
almost closed when
we have to be, the
flowers
seasons
that
we are

the night goes the fog-horn
in cold weather steam
and the mines how black
accidents are all
places
slow up, round, lengthen
a shade still reception
of the idea there
making a snowman
how much dirt
mute time passes

the pastorale
symphony
the snow is
white white
in the yard
sunshine
the wind sheep
what do the clouds graze
in safety as
a child feels
heedless
of indoors
positioned slow like the aerial
half blown down
by the freak blizzard
what this place may be
unreally cold and wet
when the music was conceived

in the air the slant snow
the bird rising away
from the wild and bare tree

I forget the color
upstairs, the aerial
on the roof
the trees
half-way to the horizon
the seas
falling beyond

flag waving

none too fast NOW
the man who's come out
the back of the one-room store
in the parking-lot
lower jets and
trails blacker

you know where you're going?
Life the placid
time-bomb
how long the
other end of the fuse
earth
coiled up in
how backward running
brake to re-enter
and all
you eat yourself out
all ways by the tail
it’s all moving the road
taking you away

towards
the boiling point of water

cool lighting and fires

Canadian to Australian a
comparative distance
the earth bends
travel's a descent or
pulls or a tendency
among the stars
it gets heavy
it grows light
feathers are good for clouds
and rain streaks
the artificial cavern under Denver
the poisoned lake
the shivering land

sea smells
smoke
weed

how long was it with us ? ?

the lower the more open
to the skies
the wind blows
across the corner lot
the grass in the graveyard
husbands and wives

my back
to the front of the house
inside inside
what is this sense of moving
through life

the apple gone
no more tree
its shape
its shadow
streaked skies
the birds on the ground
picking up crumbs
sun rain
bellying cloud
one woodpecker it seems
the last time to the right
flashing doors
where they took down the green-house
sticks
tarred paper
odd nails
flowers grew
quite a few fires
an old phonepole lowered cut
some use
saw-horse method
electric hand
bolts
power
a neighbor's pear
in days frozen the wild
bend-ups
over
sheered off
joint by joint
the bridge far in the air
distance beyond sight
stump stump stump
level
