Miasma of art
The 
more the merrier is my view 
seeing the levels of the world and how easily emptied space 
is
Here they made the perfect pots 
on the beastly floors 
the spoons and knives randomly dealt 
and tread on the pine-cones 
bare-footed 
to cut wood 
and here, the women went undone 
till noon, plaiting
Is it serious, or funny?
Merely? 
Once this happened 
and the cooks brought food to their seniors in wigs
in dressed-stone mansions;
I am omnipresent to some extent,
but how should I direct my attention
sufficiently to what I desire, to
stop, to
what is charging on the roadbed, what
going away, the
fire-gong, people and busses
and even in my room, as
I know
the waving sun
the
constant ephemerals


The midnight birds remind me of day though they are 
out in the night 
beyond the curtain I can't see 
Somehow bedrooms don't carry tradition I 
and the boxed radio 
is off. But what am I reading 
inward performance 
Has relevance. Allows me to hear
while something speaks. As for the bed
straightened by visible hands 
only is it huge 
when I feel down in darkness 

D y i n g
And yet they hunt the great whales
the beauties they see
finally dwarfing them
Around the world
What's more
they name them, and these are not tags
but inexpressibles
their function
and even the unwanted,
and time
to think lower than
spheres

Noise grimaced
we took pleasure in the heavens
the close sky
although we knew we could not have seen it
and the flash fell expanding the light
up the beds and walls at once
dying, leaving the star distant
although we had known all season's heat
like a room's still air here
slowly I have sometimes heard my ears click
as if some naked siftings bared themselves
and who know how these needles come to the body
Another moment Day passing or
beside it,
out of the corners of the eyes
the wind like the rain, it can't be swallowed
rain as rain, walls shut in
virtue of walls, Rain is a forest
but the wind is too light for a sea
Under it still the skin is unquenched
And there are not two dangers either
none moving away, in front forwards
to my head
though sometime it will rain, hail or
still more variety
gripping the shoulders
before or after our deaths


from the sustaining air
fresh air
There is the clarity of shore
And shadow, mostly, brilliance
summer
the billows of August
When, wandering, I look from my page
I say nothing
when asked
I am, finally, an incompetent, after all

tending the grass, all night
everyone beautifully
(by themselves the same thing
time for the surroundings
against the strip of hill
ending low, a space
on this side, hut for clouds
