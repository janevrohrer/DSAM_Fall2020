the first to get it
In the spring suddenly light the trees
are green and round prows, the birds
seem to like the gape wires
firm and continuous shriek
tossing mattress, back to the sky
in the drain there are still nests, the light
from next to the grass disappears
among the crotches, leaves, and the sun
spreads someplace The
hard shrubs would fold in
The man changes it, the saw
dangling to the heels, in the air
earing the trees, pales the sky
where it comes through, where there's no other birds
--and where are they now-- for the trees must
stay green
