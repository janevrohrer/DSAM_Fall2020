trees and
cloud over back of the hills
horizon to horizon
and fog cloud ... trees
blown through with the wind
cloud over back of trees
horizon to horizon
and fog
blown through with the wind

so years been pa s.s i n g
the road quiet
still often enough
night and then day
light up in the sky

again clearing
the sun out, shining
after 2 or 3 days

and a time is there
windy
between storms

this is good
candy
too
