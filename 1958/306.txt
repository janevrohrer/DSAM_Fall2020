The old papers
in the old mailbox
before they’re delivered
the old houses
are all right
the grahndstahnd at
Wonderlahnd
pilate's daughter
we go again around the pylon
the splendid fuel
tank up
inquisitive dog
a jumping boy
flat on the wind
ok
the baby's soon grown
tenement slice
the railroad bridge is
who would think of coating it
the radio billboard
which is an ad
same as the street
