WHO KNOWS JUST WHEN THIS WILL END
Space a meeting, so
when the wind blows
in the chimney
the bed creaks
and keeps creaking, while
the wind flies
the clouds passing
over land, the roof
nevertheless, impenetrable, as if
I've put it there, it, still,
stirring perhaps, over our heads
where we know,
the size of different rooms
projecting, discounting the clocks
we needed, the shades hung
by the air, while the wind sails
out in the dark walls
