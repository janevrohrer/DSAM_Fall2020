Middle of the first thunderstorm sirens
Some reflection down People sitting
idea Water and fire the walls more or
less in the circle triangle
roads, the flashes of hooves
one time rained
on a wagon clutter
of the slow night whatever happens dripping
ice these, real bits
from the roof the fields are green
and wet sounds, heavily
absorbed and let fire
lurk in the ground to
pair stones out
of sight
