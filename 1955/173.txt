the foundation waits (will rise)
between morning and afternoon
for a 2nd load of dirt
the trucks move
eyelessness, uncovered
windows, the outdoors
toothless,
the garage
open like a grave
or a child perhaps
faces play, have played
the quaking stone
they have wandered over from the next lot, their
bikes a near way
slowed the gulls
(a surprise, the difference of time
soon the walls will have been wholly
real
even on the hot nights
though they were not always the same
