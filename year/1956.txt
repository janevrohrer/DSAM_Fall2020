The sea dances the heavy lights
below the wall; a distant
crash sinking, matched changes of color
strain and confusion, out of which the storms are bred up
after this hour, hunting for sewage and spells
garages and the back yards
where the arrowheads might sift behind the woods
hammering wings the
hutch the
boat lifting between houses
there is the screening of loam,to
leave the rocks out, pitiful ash
crumb in the dropless afternoon
of wine-cellars, accents
of ancient yeasts and that wire
slant of sky filling our eyes
blind, to run back
the beaten snatches of dust through the rain
or violent cold echo
They hunt clams In a lull
at the sewer outflow we dribble our own banks
dwarfing tin
and blocked sand whistles, gouge
quaking
pebbles floated in the night like ghosts
bird-speckled. The wall reins
the barren grains of sand, bareness of shadow
the mud levels endlessly stilled
awnings endowed serene
Then later
to return and
pop balls on the empty brick
and mortar, (the dirt stirs, the sparrows on the
nest overhead in the drain split jaws
as the sunset, in full, passes down

children's sizes are indeterminate
then there's those ones across the road
they live from a lawn split by a driveway
—well, let's go in, the kitchen someplace in the middle
the tv in the corner down the aisle ,
the basement window shows the circled grass
the kids have a dog that's ownership
Where he keeps his hat, they sometimes put on
they push the sidewalk for four lots
and
take a diaper car for a milktruck
so a year is a long time
the snow more reflective than the glass
they see coming at moments in their minds
and far away,the trees stay bare
in the fall the cats will spawn, usually
and birds come out in the sky, the nests dry
like crusts, and plants in the earth, fires at the gutter
the hens smelling the chickencoop
or garages hot, ragged water and oils
they rake up the beds with their toys

Just like when she was little
the cricket sang, but the
sky was remote
this summer
the hen-yards obsolescent
and the walls often not very wide
the bed a ship to sail again
yet more of a ring, dissolving in the waves
she tossed from side to side, there was
nothing under her, there was nothing
under her, to feel, she had gone too far away
.bed,and a quiet night
The clouds went over, the trees grew
out
covered, different from weeds softly off earth in the
non-violent sun
broken)
wires stay on
carrying messages
of no content, but steady
the birds roost
she had moved a moment
the 13th floor
the room all fixed
up the stairs
to the roof the
grating
old heat
outside
the walls
smokes, matches simultaneous with
idea
change
the cellar, all at one time the
room
phone by the window
to do anything
across the country
voyages
somewhere near the beginning
the rain noses in front of your face
when the clouds thicken, the vague increase
gives you a silence
though widest are the blue points
of the ultimate reach, taking itself
to the sides wherever you go
below which the hammer-thin clouds
beach their imperceptible ways
she lies at the world
in thought, as before
looking up again, without need of a bed
or thinking, where there used to be hens
fallen asleep

take for granted
the world going forward

no younger
an illusion of this
no, a
death
announced
Sometimes a squirrel
affectionate dogs
nosing in spring
off the corners
cars, carts
on final levels
stretched up
and the overhead craft
in all weather
like windows
Whales
conduct a feast
near the cold used surface
awave like floes
the broken-off scraps
smells
the huge climate
o a lively day
keen
light, imperceptible turn
coffin of justice
among bottles and fruit
the beach I hear not quite
the next road
dancing
pavement of threads, things
horns bicycles papers
on hands
because the street-light shines
steady
and the leaves fall
like a few stars
throughout the night
and the trees moving their bones
in the wind
which doesn't need light
the cold wind Lethe
the strong wind they sleep
the objects of a dream
growing
letting their
hands, such as they have, down
they are unconscious of
the sun
A response
the muffled trees
Later it snows
that is, after the
leaves and the sun
Considerable time
variety of paths
through the same space, thickens
and piles up
what was maybe fog
when the sea smelt
and came back
as it comes back
now
the tides
the sun spinning
the moon having its
different sides
the world
hardening
the trees pore
white under the shadows,
the fading, loose sea

today the rubbish truck
has a green body
it is autumn here the leaves still on the trees
early, though distant morning, forenoon sun,
immediate struggle, bent
card, cans, boxes,
dusts, a toy
shovel, a bottle, assorted pages,
wrapping, socks, the iron to a mattress
but no bone
or, since the war, cat-scraps
there was once a hound burying one
until he placed the right barrel
smoky straw stamped out in the wind
packing parked minute
on minute
as far as I can remember
it has always been full, the eventual stations
progress
when it's about to rain
the green slats again
today put up like a wall, filling
the gap in one side
garbage long, low and slant-roofed
and the ice-cream goat that reputedly ate tin
perhaps in Bolivia
a clean pediment behind
and they all used to dump out back of my house
the loads piled high
moved in the wind
they stick
heaved up over the shoulder,
like hay in a nest, stomped
down, ashes, that barked music,
however
apotheosis
idle from
the teeming field
pin buttons
the queer shine in the weather
to rust
The river of waste
swiftly, the rain speeds
and slows up
not like when I was a boy, change-over,
the earliness
as tomorrow
and the next day

yes, Wolfe
this harvest, harbor of stars
the up-turned mirror in the window
earth on my bureau
I the blank face
i pale and tremendous
dawn, blinding
eyes over the sun
sodden and unfamiliar
the hours change
to the south

I've been a bad boy
no personal god,because
we couldn't settle down
too big to

it's true, at the heavy back, all of us, those
tapestries are light
your face forming
too great a height
into a grave
a hole in the lawn
or the brick steps
robins may eat worms
or fallen leaves
the suns
work
to have a good
time
all
together
a baby comes fictitiously
into the world
he seizes as concrete
Milestones the caterpillar's
inch
unable ever to gauge
butterflies
and the thrashings of man
making the seasons heavy
the moon thin
as may be 
bees
they sleep
bows of the spring
again
fish
near a rough tank
steep
inland
behind waves
the piers splintering
simple pieces of light
That lump of a moon, in the sky
past like anything you want
complete
all seen with different eyes
fading off slowly, halves
by halves
divided windows
bring in the shattering depths
then clouds
I think what passes over our heads
are the huge things
lightning, blind
split
naked immensities of the whole
the stroke of it
bars over the street
and poles no higher than the leaves
branches
time intact of the body
invisible extent
Leaving myself, I leave eternity
God, Melville said, nearly to begin
yet the moments are undivided; window-frames are objects
occupying nothing
but plain space
streamlined? hardly, you’d say
except in parts
and a little odd, too, and
always both sexes way
inside, millions of islands, as
rough an element as we've got, but
Wind, there are other things
like stripping and handling parts
as we find them, propping them there
to be more attractive why
that fish, driven all over
by it like a storm by which she sailed
enough staging
to float on, but not with their wives
a fine business, even so
whatever size you please
That island, too, spread one white eye
which we give it
if we can
(caveat
the parts relating to each other
not even the absolute
The sky was empty, right above my head
emptiest of all, above the gutter
when the gulls passed on
with no particular smells
and the leaves held to the puddle
reflecting the wall thin window
the new house
like a junction, complex craft, tenting
the train railing off
where the sun blazed on the stainless door
for a couple of hours
below which I couldn't see
I couldn’t walk far enough
to stand over it
those leaves about the first to come down
Identify the earth with consciousness
they were lost
standing
for some time, time
all those points to the compass
the weather arrived
by such a manner
painting on over the sun
the landscape brought home by sound
noise
the jet spines spread in the sky
there
is the waste tractless?
of outline no possible
but somehow it's hard
circular that's
event
but the permanent gets more commonplace
quick
moments pulling what memory
