Those walking anonymites 
Nuns against
The Renuan holy man
The night has some billions
if you had a thousand, eyes, the world would still be round
these are blinders
the blind look up
the blasted old jaws
(ribs showing through
htke the squatting boys, at the party
they are naked at night or
the blank sun
or should be, they should be, though
to clothe yourself
when it is
uncalled for,
the change
the youngsters with shoes in their hands
bare legs, the tightened pores out
coming back from the water
which sounds after them, skipping a few more rocks
and butterflies
in the wind, the heated shade
