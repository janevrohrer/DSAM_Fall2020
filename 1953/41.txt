Occasionally
Well, they’re used to it
in those days we
didn’t have floors
like now, no
electricity no telephone
radio no vacuum
cleaner But don’t you think it’s too bad
that college isn’t nearer home?
You could get bread for five cents
I came here no faucets
a pump in the yard
Grandma raised a family
one room over there
The Two Old Men
born in one bed
What are you talking about
Eskimoes, even they who remember
slightly better times?
while they live
they barely balanced their land
No consequence
Remember now
ALL I CAN ADD IS
from where the war is
and more hardship
you’d be surprised
said grandmother
after seventy years
after a hundred years
