front riding backs
where
wind mounts birds
decide
hunger men, women
the summer load
the whole
stir
generations
sparrows
pigeons
tables
sometimes white, and
peppered rocks as
even some gull
far off the roof
wing of the bar, expanse to
ice-cream, ugh,
tossed coin or anything no more , busy
with square meals, they see them thus
flapped straight to the
iron green,as soon as
anyone's gone, all the
customers, maybe
try to eat /figure
stones too
and otherwise float around, the
constant use traffic
in the street they may stray on, coming down
say looks like your head, at what food
or views
still plain, these
old people, housewives
businessmen, as well as the
looping young, how
a large bird goes instantly
in air, behind cumbersome more
harp does he ever see it's
no matter
a few quiet dogs
maybe
as the owners
grounded eyes
necks voice
open hand in the way
greeting
they skip that too
lines
tides of the air
