WALLS OF THE AIR
Yes, the crackers still make
an impression, even after
the endless war
which, if it ended, would have no end
because it can't, or be hidden
Each burst lasts two seconds, yes
it's calculated
although I couldn't say
I can't see how it carries so far
I was there before
The grand finale overlaps, which is
considerable
producing an echo
then a retreat,
sometimes laughable a sport
