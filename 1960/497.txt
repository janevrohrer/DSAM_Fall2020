all across the street
my bare plane 
the water i feel
leftover rain, the cars wash
and sprinkler
let fly to misting corner
drop, brevity
of the last spray, the size
course
power of a descent, the sphere
flat
surface
weightless formation of vision
a clear front
reaches to everything the pebble
this is still
country bouyant has become a tack
stands in the 
nail of nothing
earth gutter part
flagpole down at 
the other side
joining
multiple
light and the sun
back of each house
all water disperse
