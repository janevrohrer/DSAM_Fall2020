a puddle
wind in the day and night
all it takes
a single branch
to shower down
and a few twigs
reflections
dissolve
one center
to rough edges
walls
and to see the sky
as unreal
the gnarl
in the freshened water

Ply with chocolates
oranges
Death
you are attending to
the juicy imagination
spreading, silt, but a river
I woke up forgetting the dream
whatever I said last night
the morning again sky
blue bend wall, space
where the sun comes in

The clouds move as
you can see
how the ships made it
by the old clocks
the outings of wind
there was mind
and room for belonging

so many days have passed
the sun like a shadow
afternoon lying out
there have been lakes of cloud, cars parked in long lines
among houses a cat
looks down
refinements of radio staffed
coil above a
fender a spring plate halo
and he hasn't shimmied
the tv
pole
squint

Washing between the buildings
Holland the clear sky
over the hay-loading
the clouds'
brief rise a temperate substance
as if the white mortar of history
the grounds of people canals
mirror the overhung banks dividing
bridges and is water deep what
opens the roots as calm
oblong
even the streets are shining
What happened
to fire, the clouds
out of hand, the machines'
free fall, sewers
fouled up, accuracy
of destructive laws
Measure of bridges, into the endless boats of water with
those who would waste
monument to the underground
suicide, and the reckless put it off
to the next moment
quiet
fog
roof of trolleys
cobbled
floods
night
mills like a tiller
varying distance of wind

Sound and beat swell
funnel of space
dragged in earth
planes eddy, the shaking
cold, fish jump the horizon
slats factory colors
we realize a finish
there is a tower a
vast dome
a dining car there
a sliding seats
sloped down
the girders truckload of stationwagons
a few benches at the sea
or hens crated
traffic island
the oak starlight glimmering with flowers
sometimes the sea does turn warmer
the gulf of cars engraved
from everywhere
the dawning ends of the world

sounds like Africa
badly scarred but beautiful
legs
"beautifully scarred "

trees
light flying one leg
birds in the leaves
which thick sound
ready ready ready, will
stream away
or a taste
quiet, smelling of height

the dead
light
the walls
no stream but
the union
things are
the wonder
tree
thing see now
pole corner
front moon sliced
sun
catch light shadow
a screen flopped
loose
it was one of those blizzards, one
on another
the shadow of slow
day
passes
the gulls flying around
ruddering balance
the wind lit
eastward it seems
maybe it's the stars
a little lower at night
a broken-up plane there is
touch sea
there is
the wind
I was disappearing into the sunshine
you live the
hopeful
life
to see
depth to the moon

mist of quiet
up to the clouds blind
another hot day
industry, suits off
in Yiddish roll up the sleeves
after the cemetery
the car
window
over american toy
plastic,inc ink
the night developed
with stars at marine
supplies the bridge lifts
clearing water
the choppy seas, continuing
here theyâ€™ve made it
the billboards don't peel
there are years now gulls
or lights on their edges the dining places are fine
they buy their fish
70 feet away
and the brick school
is quiet with its lawn
and stone corners, a street at the side

great multiple
time bare
track
a line
of clear windows
a space set
the city
yard
jaws
of music continual waste
a vast pine
the town
room for woods
how much could you place in the sky
the river
what's your shape
dust floating around how many
thrust down
to final seconds
as if under the boards
mounting papers
days and nights lower
beside roots in the earth
close off the winter, like death
the splits you go in
the rounds of idea
the panels vaulting
teeth or diamond eyes
confronted in the street
Sibelius, shaking like the rain
the vibrations wet
relief
there's narrow joining
or some book you move on seas
the hillsides of the past
the mouths of burrows light

the white shirts there
how
to revolve
the sea
the ceiling, blends
in the sky
the rim
beams
buckets of the ocean
un peu de deliberate gull
above music sleers back,
tours horns, pulls
away

d e la m e r
(my old pal )
expression
listeners
for the horizon
jog
thought
gallery
or the body
sit still, why not
arms of sand
some other time
you bring on a fisherman
it was one end of the beach
mixed with the forest
a dark ground
a horseman, slowing for the distance
to disappear
and echo
the twig
thread of sound fold wind
this union, 00 pieces
at full scale
come out a million more names
above the town
at night, where the beach is, cold
containers
