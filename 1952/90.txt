Learning
to live while merely existing
Compound them
together more How could that be?
I am dragged around
or my mind would wander, a stem
not very often but still
a center of perception
everything
view
Dogs, old dogs, can't
move to a smaller apartment
to let the growing families
in. Are they
afraid of the walls?
Hence; loss of efficiency
