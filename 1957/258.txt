Pure.
on the 60 mile highway
The sign. Falling stones
from a five-yard cliff
Why shouldn't we get there
blinded to sure speed
the rotary canyons
inscribed bare speed
the countryside
one blade of grass
isn't enough
and burned-over stars!
the wind at the sea
building, the railroads
tension
on a quiet Friday, smoke
the blot hills
interest to the blind
like the random fires banks
