Goodman, taste
that clarinet, Amadeus ,
the night-long draught
the great mass
THEN
that's time
that moves like a god
In her quiet motorcycle
little car
it's a cinch to drive
The vast illusions
never move off
the miscellaneous movies
shack
the stages are frames
but limitlessly wide
look at the park
something a shipped town
other full periods
instead of hanging around
you people hanging around
the old peanut bar
and the aisles
which might be a church
fanned by factories
at the end of which a glade
grownups in the mind
the tv is too small
