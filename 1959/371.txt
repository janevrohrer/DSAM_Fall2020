IT'S ALL OVER the Anne
seagulls boating the air
the attic just wood Frank
the glass broke, and the door
let them come up and get us it's
no use they
are the enemy
the mad bands of the nazis
breaking in
the silent
flanks of the old works
silent forever
stand where you are
murderers, where is spring
now, the earth
cities revolve the mind
corners
markets
a drift time at the rafters wash-line
in the upper regions/in
the sky
