De Limits
and how to make pictures of the weather
Nobody can tell We stumble
beyond the impossible cyclone and woods
into familiar streets by the coast
or diminutive lakesides,through their trees
at the bottom of the hill, different from the sky
and staple shades like winged land
and while the orchestras still are present in my mind
the forecaster does well speaking of fronts
I live in continual air
Which might round my self burst
volumes of noise and
thick slopes blurring the smoky chimneys
like
ancient and foreign horses
and even when conditions are ideal and there are
still scheduled
as many as thirty games
in the middle of the year you dread the fall
waiting for what follows, when animals must retreat
and the winter must be got through
then. Then, you occasionally see
the snow sharpen
through certain windows and
memories looked forward to
