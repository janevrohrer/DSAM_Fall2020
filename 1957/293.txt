Something that really happened
there, the thought of meaning
at the end of history an old book
like open casques
black and white facing the sky
and the serpent
the vine become a buffed stick
the names of places and produce and men and acts
as I used to conceive of the woods
as a not deathless mass
or the tracks a necessity
"what this is, I can see his"
the lack
some nonsense
while they wouldn't understand
a gardening of verse
a history of england
