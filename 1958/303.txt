That was b-flat
The earth before me, and the sky
and you talk
the plunging sleep, echoes of great
work, unfinished day
swing the contingent machine
the sun constant a slow
depth small dark
and goes over into a lost moon, ugly animation
but continues and keeps on
rising
shot by explosive pasts
in brassiness and beauty
time is complete
no panorama
I don't care
the tree the thunder leaves
and the instrument on the table
is a useful thing
the 9th
swinging down the street
alone
