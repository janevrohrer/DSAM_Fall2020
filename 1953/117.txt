Danger in That, Too
Time and again, different, the same
the houses, snow or/ and the trees
fire signs put at the distance
(bricks and slick chimney
time
one place to another, and
the present always is here
well a different concern
*
didn't want to be tired
wanted to stay in bed
could've been satisfied
*
birds on a snowbank
their shadow
on a back wall
shrinks in the dawn
a tree reaches
the sun a balloon
the roof grows warm
