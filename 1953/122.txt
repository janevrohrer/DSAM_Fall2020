With the world a chameleon, I come
from the house where it kept me
Now the water is all aground
and there's a nest dropped on a crotch
beautiful storm. like a great curving wreck,
the light waves chiaroscuro how long
the plunged cars before it closes up.
upstreet the buds are springing in green
this is the sea
and seagulls cry
