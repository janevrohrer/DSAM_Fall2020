world without end
and the back yard
phonepole
branches
sky
transformer 

the fast and slow
to see the world
how old can you get
the healing taste of sleep

zigzag
branches
sky area
perspective
around the house
near a tree
more or less wonder
always a first time
is nothing too new
a feeling it might continue
getting up
delays enough
to be
awake
the return planes busses
at the same time as
buildings places there
inside having a ball
difference between circles

spraying down still solid car
yellow
and it glistens
so it's spring too now
the street with plums
out
how much time
the bark growth will
drive away sound
cat in
back and forth
window less

Hot Day
O Boy Expansion
swinging the arm

roofs
leveled
skyline
wires
shadow
moves
frond
pane
mystery noise
wave
wind in
the morning
pipes

enough
voluntary remark
well, thank you anyway
a pretty warm day
out the window
distributing leaflets
blue car's driver
behind trees
funny how things appear
if there's no whatever time

0 Jerusalem
fighting for a waterhole is one thing
a dispute over a graveyard is
something foolish

a crowd of
wires
pass on the
raindrops
the trees through down
might i
as well
come out here
wet bark day for
brahms
substantial
reading
how old
far am i going
in the dark
glistening some
things let up
movement
to have
birds
besides wind
no chimneys on the equator?

shaking a tablecloth out front
and loose shoes
a street empty
again while
blue sky some
sun trees
leaves seeming a barrier
across the walk
roots pushing it up
not far off
slabs
a little roofing turned over
grass cracks
umpty
sleepy outside I feel the cat too
in the sunlight licking away
diligence length
the cat knows where he wants to go and
can judge how far to fall

absolutes are nothing
like the sky
an
illusion
there are clouds, houses, stars
the air's
wet
streets roofs
hills in mist
branches
shining
January
sun
shaft
rain
