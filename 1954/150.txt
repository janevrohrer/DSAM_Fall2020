Why that light should always be shining
by the door --even when the sun's out
of the new dormitory
which has windows instead of inscriptions
or vines gripping the rough
and yet inexorable in their routes
then is this a plane or are they stars
advancing, from my view, at nightfall
with prismatic dusk, weakening
(yesterday there was a sound
behind me
bringing the canopies closer
and so brief
suggesting they were unreachable, or
partially seen
or familiar clearing
if we could always be there
the quiet courses of current
through the blank labyrinths
the curb of a district
once more the scene held
