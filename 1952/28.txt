This
the weather surrounding us, even blue
from our nostrils even
walls of storm, soft or
horizontal sea
scape, height above which can't be reached
the abstract ceiling, the sky Think it petty
the way it is think
excuse riding life like a horse
up and down up and down or
a car is it
but go inside
see it, looking outward
the room is like a nursery
a seagull of certain definite loci
makes backgrounds, dazzles and sleeps
at one time induces sleep
A book on my knees, my sensitive reflex
A gull, diving, looked like a plane, and scared me
but just enough
yet allow the air into your heads
Such different surfaces prevent
distraction stop in the end
contemplation neutral room
Still the weather changes O
be the same
day and night
blocks the window and the sea
what to expect
these
things

pect
