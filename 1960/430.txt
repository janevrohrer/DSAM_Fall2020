the sky cross the desert the dry
miles
for that color your feet
dangle a tenuous height
back to the mind
wood
pieces
paint
applies
canopies
touch motion
to what's left
in seconds
the valley of events
music the clouding air
noise cows
and peace a long brown rain
affirm your grasp
with a close forehead
neck and neck
some enemy
hoofing
(the spent years
the complications
every day
from
mount
the ground
