bright ambulance child toy
fire-truck
gather together
jokes and everything, after
turkey
and one let down
a blue cigar
night
trees break out
the upward corner
green in the morning
the hard runway, the wind
through turrets
pivot glass, chair jackets
spread on
the birds busy
weather
the tilt of wires
the sand blown
beaks, each hole dug
the leaves at some crossing
abandoned rails make
a track
clinking
shutters, wooden hedges, beds
bay the route 
cars behind
the evergreen
and grocers- stores
the wide oak giving
cross-lots of the sky
center
the roads swerving by,
one shaving
curtain of rock
smoke drifting
shadow of the chimney
