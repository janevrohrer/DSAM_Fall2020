RURALS
On all sides in a T
houses invite forwards
further on doubles it
finally between
the nearly floral curbs
so, knowing they have the double
these ends
and the rear asphalts the clotheslines the
grass meeting
the brick sides
lead really to a tangle
of few bushes or wire
hurdle
the poles, of an older street
instead of the grounding hills
or more across the open
and
from the way you came
the straight passenger train
except, one hill where the whole set
is put out
the stem, barrings, points
the slate country road the only thing
that avoids
Grand Canyon far off
and not to be rounded
Way in; a tree-hut
still here
no fences, no no fences
