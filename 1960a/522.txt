should the candle
burn down in the silence
to a radio
mad dance in the flame
its 24-hour burlesque
fine and
reflexive surface
corners water through the sink
pipe to pipe
we are informed it is
10 out
the stoop
the ceiling meets
windows
the walls
of a round glass
caving
surrounded by
a bare cold
the heated seas
you imagine the pots of flowers
from the next room
the burrows squirrels and hares
might be, prints in the snow
