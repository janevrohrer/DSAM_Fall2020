Bracing
the sky streaked
infinite shapes then flat
straight off, easily, birds
one bird spreading out legs
minute on the garage again
a brief slope the cars
behind this poplar so they
bare the way raised
past the hill, cliffs, hard
fumed skirts, now you
see, blue
is enough oh sparrow
to go under
the crest
the unrealized edge of it
bay down or later or
fold on the memory
the same one you should think
skim up to the porch rafters
buzzing
as a bee, disappear, in there
you can wonder about
sleep
fading releases the sky
and deepens, before
black open window
