Close up
I lie across the bed with my matched feet
we live in the great w-orld
the ceiling above my eyes just like my toes
It looks like I'm dying but I can't see, what goes on
In the front room a television is playing
The old movies, like we went down the corner as kids
Only these are the grade A's, the classes with affairs and bibs
In the drawing-room they are saying something as the scene opens
A repetition It's just like the first night
I don't know what's hit me, I saw the trails before sunset
I can't actually tell the placement of stars
while the beaches of my childhood may still be white
