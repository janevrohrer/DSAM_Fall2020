Near the beginning
she fed him peanuts in the zoo
which quieted
surrounded by a civilization
the bear and the odd monkey
pawed
at nothing
the fleas in the meshed air
their suitable hides
and the visible flies
the monkey businesslike
the peacock unsurprised
and earth
the dirt was simple
the keeper at meals
retreated to dark huts
holding his hand near a cage
he supported the sun
it had rained some days before
and the sunset was cloudy

IT SOUNDED
and tangled dry-
like fire
at the start of the day
the engines
control
but the wind in the twigs
or thistles, stalk
the birds are violent
the spring
they function by shouting
suddenly
all day
the houses stand some paint in
glass the dusty sun
with the fresh air
and the man who fixes the roof
top and
the transformer below
nothing except the wires
and the trees
and the boys climbing
the shed
(to leap
and break

so what if mankind dies?
the birds
the croak and whistle
has no future, either
so what?
so what?
the future arrives
the end of a stick
in my crotch
toward the speed of light
