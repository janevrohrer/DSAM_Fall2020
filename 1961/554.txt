sparrows a good time
all the mesh of the fence
the sun on both sides
through each is a clear sky
above the beach the
parking for business to
feed inside a place
while this is behind, the wall
packed under these faces
waves fall
remotely enough
and ripple up night
has strange rockers
the pocked ceilings bulbs
a mile away to smash sounds
lowered trimmings
impervious rain to the earth
water and sand
for day
there has to be night
in some circles
winter in others
huge
sealed webs
the growth of lobbies
snow held by swung
doors, tension
the plaster set pearls
all over but the sills
in the final rooms
the aisle of a bus worms
away a sight
a bathing-suit
in the back
