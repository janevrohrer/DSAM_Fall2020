Clears
Light retreats now from inside
And outdoors its fit of sense
is apt to drive us, wild
no matter how we lift the blinds
invites us, lures onto
days
Too much from the earth
from the bare earth
to bear
after suffering
summer
winter
too much
Spring promised
overabundant
we steeled
shiny
welcome into our bodies
Last autumn but a memory
should've swum, dipped
once, in that blue offshore
roll, grass, corner you
the pressure from inside sweeps
