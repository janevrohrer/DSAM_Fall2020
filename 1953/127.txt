sleep through woods
and thus even the hills)
buildings
signs, and what's under
(I didn't have to see
down Connecticut
suddenly biggest city
in time, spreading
like the palisades , could be gone

the whole of the continent

across the border, cross the vertical road, the bridge

each from the ground
to see you must go through
strange how street can close
the skies
since gradually the world changes
