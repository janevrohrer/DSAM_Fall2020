body of the orchestra a
gossamer time
come out of it like
not let pass
where is there choice the clock
feels low, and can't be seen too far
the landscape on the wall that
shipped reflection beside
flowers the bulk of the trees
grow on
signs of the fresh wind a street
drummed with leaves
or a wave
between islands
