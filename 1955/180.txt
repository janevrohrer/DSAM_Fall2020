Scene Edge
seeing the surroundings let
the dead tree live
again, you, liable to stare
in spring as
elusive growths are its eyes
over arms weighed
the icy reflection
permeates
winter
the fixed wood
but springtime the tree opens
so the ponds lie still
while with the wind they move as they can
When the wind's flowed there is summer, a
lolling, maybe too much
breath, the light spaced islands defined
except for the pitched gulls rounding
out of sight for
another place
as a tree
a house
levels
and the cold follows up
