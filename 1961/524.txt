The sky appears to be 
Water in your throat
or a bird's
back the transient, possibly an identical one
riding a twig, the farthest
oaught in the sun
which might
have been reflective
some changes are silent
the field clear
moon, how much
the look of a man
first moments
can be this bright
and man's pipe
extending water
accompany noise
to the ears
the tap
of earth you can bite
chrome the moon
grows instantly har
on snow sunset
still comes early
it is again the middle
of such a season
parts of branches
have been washed
the sun continues
within cold cloud 
proceed, and some stars
follow the moon now
a brilliant color
