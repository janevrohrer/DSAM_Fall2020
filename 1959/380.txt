These are the
winners of the game motorcycles
him ahead she looking
behind
the wind in lids
clouds clear under
fresh morning
a ride through noon transmute forever
a town
the seasoned old dr.
who exuded the hard human
breath legacy of latin
from the chair usual organs
wounds of the still young out on the field
in a slouch
the brief
the season of winners and
everyday hoo-ray for
school
lean out the windows to 
pound, as long as you pass
the Indians, coming
going with
the secret clearings of
moments that are hidden
by trees, ramifications
deepening leaves when they
beat the bleachers at the
ultimate reading
ravines
felt downward by the squirrel
Saturday
the concentration of spectators
blowing their horns, nose, to extend
the choral wave
they made, though the band, at the same time
drums out, like the soldiers they are
like
the siren air raid test 
topping it off, became 
a feature doom saturdays an 
open city
as the young scatter
and horns again
some reason near
sunset
