give
next door
reflection
up the street
move
the sky
do not fix
the branches
a paint can
night
is the spreading root,
, zenith
there is rain, nadir
among leaves
the forest makes birds clear
whole bodies sound
fresh smell in windows
the retreating sun washes
a truck to fish in the sewer
a green limb island
above the roof
think it over
all the cylinders, drive
rubber
wear the road
you set up
between me
and the tree
a ladder to
fluted wings
