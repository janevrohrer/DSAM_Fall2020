Clearings
As history lays in the mind
sudden houses of this landscape
I have watched going line by line
blocking the rest of it
which over years I have seen
but again it's as if time were no object
raised while the eye travels
and who can say how a tree grew with
the sky in back of it, the
visible ocean doesn't exist
really outlined in the night only
the leaves crossing the sight lost
as faint elves in the known world
Or I am behind trees, wasn't I
always like this where
except for some nakedness of winter
or fall, the regular changes come off
as I had remembered
the trees still standing paused, turned black
and my road's houses, absolute hills are banked
all present greenery, turning aside
wind displaces my sight
