-22- Piano, String
It is
A runny pool somewheres
that is a beginning
Dancer in sheets of
unconfining rain
eddy my leg.
slightly pine spirals
a cool erotic
sitting metal frame
and bells from nowhere
straining the ears out
befo
ragged lines of
Popeye the
fishwoman's king of the world
while Titian's Europe lies
a wall
trees are wild sometimes
clouds are safe
is a leaky day
what does safety mean?
