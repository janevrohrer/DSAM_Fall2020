A, Is it Serious
A book with a jacket
below the title having
a typewriter, black, is
about what?
Guess.
among good and bad it says
somethings
against the plausibilities
(with anecdotes
of happenstance
Luck is out of the question
no good for this sort of thing
as such a wild affair
might lead us anywhere
But that is just like that
doll of a machine
which after it had crammed the fingers
I had the idea of sitting on.
And as I say
It's time that deus am I telling you
unsettled a few of these things
which are just unlucky
as well as lucky
and by this very fact
the course, though logical is
all wrong
and they haven't been treated right
though he is very natty and
reasonable
so this, in spite of his honesty
it's trash
and not worth the dollars or cents
(and has a chalky pencil round
and thick blue besides it
