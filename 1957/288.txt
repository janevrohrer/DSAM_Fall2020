the mad bus at sunset
autumn and winter wind
The hydrant with barrels
the poles on a Thursday
morning
ends below the sky
The sunshine is odd
Memories familiar
ity The
houses with empty souls the
new life
the fresh bottles, rid of milk,
not to be seen through
the wind, stains, streaked dirt
the birds quicker than the clouds
or absolute height/flat extreme
hampered by the buildings
plane
facilities for the beach
stare under the trucks
the debit of gas burns
the rain hollow sewers
where they pour the pipe in
mists And the trees
soak the air branches
low bound in the wintertime
happy habit
Pray for rain, the radio man
then GIANT MACKEREL, buy cadill
You, better,
before forgetting we have to
buy our lingerie at the shop
Goodbye
acs
leave it on
Always some threat of losing the sky
when thunder, refreshment
cloud, unequal to planes
unequal to cloud, reflections
the water and deep land
Halls of a couple of
and at night the lid
lengthen, gears rock
but the picture stays
lights
marvelously stable
cars
the glamorous
things
ceilings
towns
like the family romance
garbage going outside
disappearing
or the print easing away in the cellar
bring you back to the dark forgotten
made into flowers, rank days
but the cellar lies in wait, now
you almost never go down there
or even up look out the attic
where the boards hold you, out of the tree
and spread,confining you to the present
imagination or rippling storm
or swim where you can't have any clothes
If even you put on wheels or could fly
I wonder what it would be like
Meat you can't see the rain
except in front of the door
and out on the long roads
shortly the truck produce
tail boards
heat of the metal sun
Instead of a blank field where the frost comes, beautiful weed
these women, their pictured houses
man a diligent being
the plain.
cricket from somewhere you can't see
mass escaping in the mind sound
trees
brick
seeds,
wind that shakes or crashes
the cat squinting the country
leaves on a few old stones
serious animal, the lonely living
in danger, springing under the sun, other
summers become lost
even in themselves
though you could try to take on
single mass
the houses, wide like a flower
poured box
like the once-stained orange crate
the ceiling plainer
hang of the air 
cars like waves further off in the night breeze
where the windows open, season through the dark
distant a minute, flat on the sea
the birds cove on the wire out to the fishing
surf by the island tossing repeated grounds
sand
plane of streets the vast light
street fragments, shadow of planks,
corners
game, or life for the winter
the island straight on these miles
the papered rooms on the road back
towns light in the evening
Crown of blades
4 off
high in the air
a straight whirl
at 3 o'clock
sounds like the air-line
across the bay
12 hours later
it's the sun
who would think it could cool off
bad time the end
of that
it's all safely
clamped down in the night
frightening and quiet
my spine is knotted, really
separate
the earth enormous from light and dark
a nice daily
mind
