Parts of Salem
down to the folds
I saw the upper halves of cars
without the wheels I know to be
moving around my corner, and
the action of those sitting there still
forward, drivers and children, hands
a new hat on an old man
the street sudden smile at noise
last among the marble sites
and the brick exchanges
rises of earth
filled and massed with human stone
parking space alleviates
ancient commons which were lonely
and magnificent prairies breaking the heart
because it was five yards off
talkers at one curb lost as
if forgotten yet
what has there been, now, to speak of
Girls and mothers of one hour
in passing in tender hair
and men counting silently
