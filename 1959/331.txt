THE LIGHTS GO OUT
Now we are alone with our thoughts
but where are they
tomorrow I can continue reading
Starlight!
candles
are a great deal
far away in the darkness
everywhere grave, settled
early like the
flowers
we have so far kept
the spread of the leaves
shaped
a long way from sacrifice and
letting things pass
for the flowers no fright
flying around in the autumn
it's late
all kinds of emotion
there was tomorrow will start
302
separate instances of
the live
the sharp focus
of industrial things
echoing country
crowds
great russia
in the bones
the sun's confusion
down on the ice
or matted grass between
brought short
silence
the small wires of life
bursting themselves
unparalleled
and the divergence
of diversion
a man inside
whatever it is
the parallel concentric
world
of wandering
grass
wave and no front
shifts its volume
something like sand
hills
