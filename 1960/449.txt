timbres remain
mourn time and deep water
but another day and
music as well as the sky
conveyor vanishing mills
night, where buildings are
is white or black
windows reflect
inner and outer
all glass surfaces the sun to
put you to sleep
vibrant with images
then the afternoon
on some walls
a waking
and beside tall grass
