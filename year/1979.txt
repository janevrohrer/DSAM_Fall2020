calligraphy
typewriters
my hat
(bureau)
the world
inside
spins

the intersection
2 levels
out the window
a fall still of night
in back and ahead
some distance
around, round, round
as there has to be
enough tunnel mouth
gears
traffic
various climb
lights
the places to go
whatever there's been
in constancy
through the day

earth slopes and
the sphere of the sky
cloudy some
blue
cherry tree
acacia
butterfly going uphill
toward a windy night
people
the half-moon already
with its shadowy mountains
piled dust
gaping seas

a dark wet night
wind and rain bow
the bush out the window
how
lights may burn
steady

the cat
dumb looking
looking dumb
I wonder
move in
on
a tree

up in the morning
ideas

from the back
I notice
a harp has wings

electric shaver fanatically
electric grazer
wind in the tree
up against the wall
glass levered apartments
clouds over the house
after this much time getting dog-eared

my old machine
new like strange

through the window reflection
a plane going north
under the boat moon
