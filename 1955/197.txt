back to it
The good things go by so softly
Themselves it is our strengths
that run wild
The good and the strong, dissipant,
an Ob- jective joy
sky
IS empty there are clouds
there must be sound
there
the horizons are nothing
the rain sometimes is not
negligible
out on the sky
the other direction
growing until it is nothing
there are mirages and numberless deserts
inside the other house
lines, broken curbs
travel and distance
proportion themselves
we must be animate, and walk
turn, abruptly
the lines are irregular
