a rider pedalling
straight
hands clasped
behind back
the road level
a dirigible
as suddenly
the first in years
with all the other things
the sky's wall steep
hardly wind or cloud
a squirrel through the fence
a green blanket
the back yard

the moon's risen
quickly
as it seems now

I was able to
give something
back when to Cid
you heartened me
as so many others
So I remember
day at
night and
when it returns

popovers
bread
for 
in the stove
albert
near the chimney
real
oatmeal
good
and apples
milk
for breakfast

now none of that

sounds like something
afoot
what's that in the kitchen
besides sunlight

shadow
motion
ceiling
streak
sky

the silence
night then moving
to day,day
into night
the sun and the stars
go on and on
for
Ben F milling
round
pressure

a fly free
some time on the window
a man looking out
wind and sky,
grain
a woman mends socks, space
closed off gradation
days shifting enough
at some point hills
rolling
brilliant white cloud
a gate
swinging back
farther
 After the film
Ecstasy (EJcstase
â–  1933,
Czech),
some of it t
to let live

Gluttony
maybe
my taste-buds
growing young

footwork
skateboard
middle of the street
between trees
sunlight

this
day's eye
so it's
vegetating
flowering
all flesh
what grass is
how ) ever it is
