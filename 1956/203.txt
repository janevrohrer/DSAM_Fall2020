Anyhow .
Life is a farce, so what is death
not even the funeral
or much later, stones
and weed
the dust in the road
and cold snows
I have become used to this
my shoes hve been the same
I remembered the sky, or yesterday
to look (most of the place
in the afternoon it was old
light, made
the next hour, dying, the
fire blew and the engines
roared in, putting on, speeded
Again,the
sun gone down
grown in the shoes, which are full
the sky changes
in ways I did not think of
notice
and others remembered
