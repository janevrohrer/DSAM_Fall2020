leaves, company in death
cascade to all the branches
one at the top, single
I thought I heard
what's invisible I feel
Wizening is essential to it
Aged in the wood
Leaves being a rush, hiding
the faded principles, rarefy outward
shades growing
sightlessly to oblivion
How many places the trees
leave, somewhere attaining
final weakness
as if unmoving
far from diffuse they
flood the levels of the world
limit the ground, head-on
the sky through empty words, bush-heaps
It is a quietness like snow
Light numbness of the mouth
filling the window
but there are no tiny sharps
However, do not be deceived
the world isn't empty
( I am more idle than this morass
street where maples cross
cars in the middle lane
dusk from darkness presently
A comic leaf now stood
up-ended on that hedge
a slight inclusive mar
