THE CAT
quiet
as

a real hot star
to whom I was too close
always to do plenty
the kitten walking tall fast
or hardly

sudden

spending his day
the kitten's growing up

I forgot
what a place to park
that big crane
nothing building
it's doing nothing
well, where's it
come from
don't

a small car in the grass
between sidewalk and street

around
the corner
of the house

faintly like sunset
