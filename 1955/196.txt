A gone
The world under the sky
clouds
all winter and summer
a snow
descends and occupies the ground
to the stars, air filled
abstract wings
on crystalline lines
and time between the stars
a broken hinge, by the garage
a flagpole mainstreet
five cats have yokked
the world
can't hold, really
too many absolutes
but I am shattered
and another time lost
while the sea
fans
the wind
or lags
an old woman's shoe
flapping
on the beach
and the awning was still there
