Immovably
Blazes the untimed room the rug
Blurred brightly, while another
is colored on the air
and one or the other is silent chewing gum
under the floor-lamp, reads; darkness
is indefinable and light sits traveled
dashing
and we're shut in
as if there was a storm, away from this
old hearth, hearth, it was draughty,
cold, as if it was an old cottage
in an old century, killing colonial time
but hear the music, gaily, from New York
