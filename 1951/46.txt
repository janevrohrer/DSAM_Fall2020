Under Same Windows
It's a flash old cloud of dust!
He wound his pitch up with a s-steer
and whether it hit or hit the ground
That was the time of their lives
Not polared by the sun
spin they laugh
and the dust laughing when they hit
and the hot grass
all the time fading it
rainbow
once even a sprinkler
and the stars were blinded
they were closed in
laughing and laughing
closed
