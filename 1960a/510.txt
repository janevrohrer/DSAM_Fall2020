50 cars
don't matter
where to stop
leaves blow
down
some above
across trees
the wind takes
other branches
a fine start
the fine day
begin
at 3pm for
darkness
is regular
the street cleared
because
houses
to lawns
it's as if the clouds roar
with my own wheels or
the roadside
into the coming stars
slats
slid up from the bedposts
dust bins
in the cellar
and corn to
be old each month
October
