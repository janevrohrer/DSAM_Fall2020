On the Wide Shore
the seagulls screech
reared to the hidden
with interior
walls, raising the streets with fields
on another side, multiplied
the sea is forward
the town back
between the two points
elsewhere
the sand mixes with rock
the roads grow
end pass unseen
together as
hedge
the sea
do not move
at one moment
the sea having little wings
Under man's convexities
from removed skies
