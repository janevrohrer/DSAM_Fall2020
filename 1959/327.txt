There is no tomorrow, her
pretty little head
the whole roof spraddled by a tv
there will be no gulls
I saw them
beyond the landscape
the smell of glorified leather
and airy tires
the huge clouds coming out front
the infinite disappears
distance invisible
if we can't concentrate
trees
level with cloud
the round circle
and sunlight
at the heart
here is a present now
gouged up
the inmost reaches of the sea
moving
or a brown lake, still hidden today
one of the same rivers the while
hills
in a bought country
the endless views
shifted
or put to a stop
!98
They imitate the life of the monkey
-there,thatâ€™s out
of their system
that dancing another
is what I
do
to get up out of bed
and look at the ceiling
the wall behind the mirror
Who wants to see himself
o it's all outdoors
better in the dark
if there is anything
my own hands are distractions
still I see the chipmunk out of the woods
behind me all the grass
in a clean frost,
or the summer
with the boats out
windows
we didn't bring in
wholly to become glass
and men run under the sea
like in country basements
