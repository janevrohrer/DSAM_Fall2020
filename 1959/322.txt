Folds of the desert
where
ever you begin
grain
We let you know
in case of attack,so
keep tuned in
every day
(all day
the weather? fine, you can
in your car
the green trees
the leaves you seem to go off on over
the tires
in one place
doing 70, it says
feel quiet
the radio out
there, junk
those, pieces,
the tiny fish street
fading high corners, a view
just of a twist of the earth
mostly sea water
corruscated barrels
I wonder how much grime on Sunday
grass
no report from the gulls, the boat
of weather, the chimneys passed, the gulls
eased on,
placed in over
the cut roof, or brow
lash squonking
as much as a possible storm
the last hours slipping fast
through till he came around
Then, the only thing to do
is to go? back to her,again
whenever I looked she smiled
maybe I did myself
nothing I couldn't do
at each step, I was carried
but I mightn't have been
up the stairs by the shrine outdoors
porch no matter what flight,
story, rear
a side window clear as if open
1959
a baby's first snow carries
little idea
what it'11 be like
his rain a warm thing
or cold downpour, the sky
glassy the field
but indistinguishable
or how should I remember
towering
observation
even the pigeons
and small birds
and the gull or eagle
had some eyes
even the rear of the truck keeping
down on the scarred road
