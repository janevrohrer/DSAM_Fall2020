To hang on the wall
some floating birds
water and trees
you escaped their place
dining out
the trees fresh
the pond's small crest
below the throat
elusively
stones
turned back
ripples, color at least
hard glimmers smell tables
men reflect
and from some splendid
hand, the clouds
funneled, curl up from the distance
the sky still round
If you go far enough
the changed weather
grass-flakes the day
a sea-wall, flower
the song of men
across oceans
Vienna Wood
the doors beckon
