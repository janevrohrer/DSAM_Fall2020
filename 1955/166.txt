and the clouds moving behind the roof-side
spreading the sun,
trees
brush
on
not vacant skirt by the distance
wired through poles
earth, the streets
for the muddy land the plumbed lawn
beginning a house clean
a high plane
around by the zenith there in
the silt blueness,
precede the air
a matter of time.
being gone
and the low fence, steel,
at this last intersection, lots
for something
as if
stream-lined
a barrel with strips
a tree passing the window,
the closed room
another tree
tipped up to a window, and the tree at the back
aside between rooms
ash-color
hill
the formless break
accoutrement
springed car
and some love
look
the stars
and things in dark places
without heat
