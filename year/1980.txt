everything like
time out
walk around down the street
if
it should end ever
eternity another word
I think we're doomed
like they say
one day
how it all counts
there's a rumbling
fine
in the air song
traffic or the earth
a constant thing

more and more
days the cherry
blocks the window
sun and rain

sun
grass, tree rows
off
hills
mute
steady motion
clouds shifting
light change
spaces
plenty of time
in the room seeing
rain
slant the
open air
heat fixed in
paving the sun
spreads to again

FOG
drifting around
cool
parts in
others quiet
birds
night settles

DISTANCE
WHEELS
CHANGE
fog
landing
sea
clouds
fog
mountain
cloud
takeoff
according to signs
getting complicated
to go there
those clouds
and this wind
as we go on
there's one way
to make phonepoles
from coast to coast
rock
covered with life
sand
wet
water
rock
fissure
Heart
remote
fast
through part
of California
noise
without
falls
up near the headwaters
cloud
level
maybe it's
counterclockwise
all day and night
the stream flows on
bank the river
the mountain cloud
rock water
invisible air
steep
ness
around
cloud
tree
cliffs
gravity
feeling
sight
of
mountains
dark
at dusk

the unimaginable
power of the beast
to feel the dark

the lifespan
the wingspan
the machine
life
wing
machine
life
wing
span
machine

Lost track
tion
bridge girders
overhead
sky
boom
clouds
the horizon the distance ends

Fire Dept.
Ambulance wait
widely spaced
buildings
how heedless
do you have to be
is that
an office
sounding like that
kids ah
what kinds of bird
propped up
comes out
through the red fence
wood gate open
hook and ladder was
hidden and
pulling away
now
after the van
how much to realize
so how is there meaning
to all the time in the world

phone
pole
whistle
lengths
track
always
as far
you
can tell
crossings
shadows
roofs
bush
trees

news of derailments
quite a few months
back 
sounds
great
places to go
goods
back and forth
whistles
and the wind blows
earth and sky the stars
steady before dawn
and they disappear again
no break yet
what a world
sleepy but
too much of one thing
and you're nowhere
the moon dead cold the sun
can get you, the light
the huge cloud dims
