I Thought Bird
Shifted my arm, my hand in my shoulder
stayed, but my elbow flat
and my other something else, a boom
on my ear, so I wasn't
any flier
My head
though
unsevered wasn't
circle
made
myself relief
against the bed
all flat agility
A
crazy flowered Crete
comic
Egyptian and
a big-jawed devil
Greek
around the
Parthenon
slight
bosses slipping
the march that morning
