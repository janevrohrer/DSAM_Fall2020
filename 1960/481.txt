An easy death
on all of you
but you will too
I wonder how it will be
cold next winter
there was a dog under the table
under the sink is where
the cat (up from the cellar
gave birth
these wanderings
go on
dispensing with thoughts
the talk
has come out
the door
clatter
a rustic wharf,
on the wall
stream
the staves
will keep in
the quiet
the men
pray
for a week
thunderstorms
across my
sight
without a mind
the tree
ist down
the window
angle of glass
years
they all talk to themselves 
one way or another
