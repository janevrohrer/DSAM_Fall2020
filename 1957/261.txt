The Elements
Out of the saddle
his young head
blinks up to pedal
the rear wheel
But he thinks
nothing of it Steel
through weeds and edged grass, while he
rides up and down the front
jolt grinding to sand
spokes. it seems
to be as simple as feet
and he has to get ahead
to look some more and come
back wave something like the sky
sea
sand
as though always wet and dry
and swimming, his toes
another day
