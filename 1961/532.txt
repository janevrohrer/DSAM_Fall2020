climb trees, merge, emanation
in lengthy arms
the depth of any water
the sky curves
Ice
hewing, geometry so
forgotten
as Well as necessary, extend
coolness
eyes
to arrest substance
lost again
slid on the street
the sun, after all, moves
a temperance
individual fish
all right
you never mind
your tongue
