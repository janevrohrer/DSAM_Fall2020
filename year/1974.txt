around the chimney
when the twist
of the antenna
flickering light
sound
apex shadows
trees
steady clouds stream

oh yeh
though maybe it's still modern
white gleaming
call it a duck again

shooting up
the town
every
once in a while
the law
keeps things going

wind turned over a car and killed the driver
how do you like that
never heard of before a
few times over

they must have spent a FORTUNE
so much smoke
up in the air goes

such shadows of birds
this day of Spring

cross the bright wall

world
inside

the swings
where the loam-pile was
the arbor of
pipes with
the vine
describe why
imagine how
make out cause

suddenly
it gets light
and dark in the
street

now
here
too
elsewhere
what
next
clouds
down
beyond the sky
and one
gust

all there in
time
fullness
could do everything,
not very well, but
not badly"

to the winds silence
mountains and plains, a wonder
