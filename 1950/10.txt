Noon
As I went down one morning, towards the sea
And met a sea-wind coming from the shore--
The ancient breath of life, that, with a roar
Like music in the heart, a mystery
Blew in my face and found an echo in me_
I thought of how, a million years before.
Inland the living came, on such a day
With such an air as this, to find a home;
And, in the hush, I sat among the sands
Wondering at the sameness of the sea.
