bird shadows mounting
the bath of
screens and walls
the light horizon
firm and singing opened
tree, trees
clumps
swaying of birds have
beaten storm , slight
in mist, all they know
water is everywhere
pile
the clouds
through numbers of days join
layers, the scattering
night, disappeared, the
trees, not any of the
stars hide and seek
