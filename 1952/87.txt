The Age of Anne Frank
Tempted by choice
but how make-shift could they be
when they were thrown together
yet had to die quietly
after all that
left in the opened air
it seems, but I must only
think the world was shrinking
steadily to the diary
though it let up
for two days
she had been away from it but she might have been taking it
when it really happened, that one time
as at first they thought it might
and for one year she lived elsewhere
