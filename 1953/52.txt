B
Is it serious, or funny?
Merely?
Miasma of art
The
more the merrier is my view
seeing the levels of the world
and how easily emptied space
rs
Here they made the perfect pots
on the beastly floors
the spoons and knives randomly dealt
and tread on the pine-cones
bare-footed
to cut wood
and here,the women went undone
till noon, plaiting
Once this happened
and the cooks brought food to their seniors in wigs
in dressed-stone mansions;
I am omnipresent to some extent,
but how should I direct my attention
sufficiently to what I desire, to
stop, to
what is charging on the roadbed, what
going away, the
fire-gong, people and busses
and even in my room, as
I know
the waving sun
the
constant ephemerals
