carriers In winter the dogs "chase
car fumes, the treads
bang out Summertime
in great bodies, come
to supper, come
the spreader road bed
shortly following birds
trying the thick
pepper
only in ignorance of sand
that's all
it is the druggist
pestle on wheels shaking come
sweeping the sea
paper
rugs
even today
news‚Äù the ads
present confiding tomorrow
and the wind blazes
the soggy edge-on past
rung up
downtown
to be
the sea splashes
the window
what milkman
through what crossings
what bus
will you take next
what flashed sunlight is still
what day-long grass is healthy
