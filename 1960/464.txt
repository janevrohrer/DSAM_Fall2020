like a sock in the earth
holed
wordless room bird
seeming broken
from upstairs
the Plaster indian pane
doorstep the archway
resurrect anytime Venus
Wooden remember green
shadow the rain
spoils a skylight
fhe farther distance up
ramp victory
Waiting
the shelter
of old bombs
past glass and hat and coat
trees corners
stand
harmonic of time
and the outcroppin
elsewhere under
"all that art
and "the old spring" siphoned
to the sewage round the park
sleeve
snough cove
Special exhibition
for the blind
horses
axe crests
stones , sticks, native
against rifles
against the walls
