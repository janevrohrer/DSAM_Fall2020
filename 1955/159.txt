The Sweep of Dark
far off
the cat stopped
cold
pieces in back of the mind
and dogs ?
even at summer
the high voices of gulls
when they disappear the sky closed
or profile of an eyelid
the asleep cheek, nose
outdoors
(there is nothing infinite because
wind blowing a paper
to a horizontal tree
like a shelf
suddenly, and away in
some other moment
thinking it almost a wire
then not at that side
over the scene, before
the street up the hill and its houses
like a man's wings
unknown, the minute still
and a barrel tipped
there with no sight of wind
emptiness of thought
itself
and canted out
of the gutter
the noise of barrels rolling
unlike the sea
the wind is all one way
-sick
like the whole day
we realize is crazy
and the headlong cries
(I always hear what
the irregular times are
and for all that the cars pass
the god in the air
