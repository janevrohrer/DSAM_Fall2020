Birthday
Every-body was supposed to be enthusiastic it
was a big hall with lots of corners
though 4-square simply, stating the case
simply, and letting it go at that
and the girl who looked disgusting, almost in bed
or was she disgusted, was
polite, as might be under such
circumstances
she said, you're not in the way
I had thought I was, with
her permanent small expression,
and
eyes, the wheelchairs had to
keep on the go, and we were all 30 or 45, time
always went by. Till all the
eyes were turned
the true surprise, a man as a
hectic native ,. doing
a strip-tease
down to a "censored" in black
3-stters, and many
were doubled, as well, by age
and bits of mistletoe were strung up
by the idea man with no fingers
who had only time for that
it turned out
being volatile
which was about as far as we got
