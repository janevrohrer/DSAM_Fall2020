A glass
of water
complexate
waves
outdoors
broken
bottom pitch all that left
of vacuous sand
and cut off a sharpened
edged core crawling there
the uneven section
sun
baked
cold underground
water is everywhere
things
enough to be solid
where a tuft even
hangs in it and then the deep vessels
ride sea sprouts there
is a table
broken
into
