spurs and parallels railing earth
though you understand sight
why is the rain straight
snow slow, the heat burst
and gulls dive only in air
still
winter the flocked coast
and white sand
shrink its cover
away you might go
and the points crag your bones
the hedge dead till it thaws
mowing like boats
when they towel sand by the beach
