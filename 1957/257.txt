Glass
I forgot, and lost a part of myself,
I remember, and it passes away
A nation, or lotus
cream, ice, the
tremendous gulf, or capacity,
waste
the field of vision
with the eyes shut
The life she missed, under her eyes
almost imposing itself upon her
Everything needed combined
appeal standard of life
the signs themselves decisive
directions
disinterested taking their part
net of the city
their torn status
like cloth planes
by the wind
Around my shoulder, your body
in full view, under the
light, blinding, of the dead sun
your mind, contingent somewhere
to the face, and the back of the neck
When you grow up you don't see
the small birds, which are still there
where the radio now is
The nursery room
Outside the wild beast
lurks
but that dichotomy
is far off
Who said that sleepers shrink, they spread,
they spread out, though they disappear.
Who would want them to disappear
they sleep hard, the brains
are switchboards, the colored wires
mean something
exactly, for them to enjoy
The death, that throws this other woman
into the arms of her neighbor
--figuring things out
it wasn't thought before
grass and smoke
grass and matchstick
grass and gasoline
the russian
rain
she came up with a cut on her nose
