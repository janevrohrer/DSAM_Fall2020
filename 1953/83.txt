Dress for the Mozart Serenade
I heard coughing out of the orchestra
and work for the organization
to put this over, produce steadily
at the front they're not perlite
but this is
both discrete and required
and did he shake in front of the prince
No, that was a
figure of speech
the figure of the leader
and rain had fallen
almost silently rain
beat, rain
spatters rain
built a wall from silence
around the trenches and cameras
as I have sometimes imagined
rooms seen from some rafter
pulling the eyes down
