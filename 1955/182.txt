The time finitessiinal
are monuments enough
and the grass, then trees and flowers
but the skyscraper is necessary
even before it is built
the clouds are radioactive
and the sky-god becomes
the earth
father and mother
ourselves surrounded in blue
lit by the sun
I take the counter in my hands
we will die
in time, and in space live
turning faces soon
