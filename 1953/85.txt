The Cat Gawked
high on the window
And the old lady died,the snow
drive in the air swaying the wind
blow
so I couldn't see her blue house
and passing people don't
quite see her, landmark character
walking, in the free months
nor the children level with the road
looking as though she didn't speak
yet as before as if she saw
cover up to hydrants the air
the hedge-lot invisibly layered from
her side, quick field
held there in multiplying up
between fences, round our homes
the walls
or floors rumble
nightplows, coming into my sleep
the ceaseless dogs paused in a line
they don't learn when they play school
the children
in front of the sun
or the milk-trucks
bound
brakes thrown
home over thirty years, circling
back in the still snow
the driver in his hour world
now that the snow is solid, that can be moved
for how much time
and liquid, too, moving first
nothing room allowed
the thickness nothing of room
it might well be the whole night
though I've never been awake all night
how long, say, have I come to the plow?
