last year's pink
poison a notice
the wind howled
yesterday , blew up the tide
beyond the sky-line from trees
through branches even more
the days before
out of
the bark clear half
the garage trellis
two arms of the vine
tack crossed way over
the bare
sun filling the air
the roof melting snowcap
down water past
summer, with the rays
some angle eventually
slips through
the flow '
the inferred motion
from the continuous, your eyes
followed, or being
dance
the remainder was good
the two windows shook
and an outer stream on the
house drainpipe
covering a side
those folds
leak point of the exit

strong
the head of his great
grandmother his
pillow dark green
in the hut the vision
here a clock
breaks out
the old
life, of moments
his enemy
naked sleeper naked
riser dream
of the sky walking out to the sun
plain
dirty green
the world
on its islands
river a little
in the surf
foam white
before her eyes, advances
trees
the splintery hard
scurrying
rain
bells
the pressure of hands
light from
your granma
beneath skin
where the dirt got in
some diet of wood
through the lamp nightly
my reflection
a month hollowing
boat
constant faces
out of sight
grubbing
stand up
for breeding
haul
clear
the stump
rubber cushions
the wheels travel
all together
fling stones
welded decks open
mute wind by the bay
change
the field
photograph
take away the furniture
woven
pass of the sun
how the sun passes
cooking fires
a process from
the day
so it goes
maternity
the animal state of
lying down
in comfort
rubbing a damp cloth
closely
looking to the gable

I will have an image
of quiet at hand
it floats away
I don't grasp
by the beach
sand ugly enough
night is cool
stars pass
over
again
the rocks tamed
sea
but no strength to travel
a lot of ends the paths
destroy places
as time
the miraculous series
so you may awake
to streets in the morning
and maybe rain
the sun already up

i sneeze there
was a butterfly
that was one
coincidence
of a sort
