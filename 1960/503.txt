Lights
which go away
and their reflections
wet from the street
cars
suns given them
pressed bodies streamers goals
a fume of ships
the sun a few hours off right now
necessity coming on sleep there is this slice of the hill
between rows like
a country road
half minute dark surface this
day the sun
stemmed on vacationers
still arranging night
the year for
making it out
