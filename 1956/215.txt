Passages
sunlight drawing from shadow, up and down the street
the dream of joy is only lightning
in the finale, beginnings so far from the end,
the short millions of poles, clouds on the sea,
the sea of human things the
leaves of men in the pure wind
of the seasons falling and swaying
over the world land
and the pitch of the open night, the lightning seeming to rend
and twist, the shadow to close in
above the flower the world cries out
time is obliterate and man turns
the false dream, missing details
that man who was deafened
we go to bed. The airs are dim
aside . marchings of men
and after this the boulevards
the grounding of arms
toys, and the blinding gulls
