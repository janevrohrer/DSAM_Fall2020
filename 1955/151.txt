the natural environment
of the cat
reverts,
in and out of the houses
the cars change
as the cat moves to and fro
articulate
or cats each step of a
world, birds
flank both sides a pole
curved on the hill
the wires became wing
the garden bushes or
random clumps or trees
a way from the year woods
the landscape surrounds the houses
or the houses around land
the clouds fast
alleys between
sometimes
the doubly cut sky
the open walls of
the landscape
