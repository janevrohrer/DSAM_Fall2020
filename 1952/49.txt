There are many things we do not know
Say possibilities are enough and more
we don't have to know it, which is good.
Jaggied potential, when it will come
Over what house grown headlong and palpable
Descending with ultimate speed, wind in the eyes
till we turn to our shelters confused moving away
and no-one can tell if any clouds bring rain
