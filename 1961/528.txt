They would not rent or sell the
building crumbles now
a fashion the snow
fine flakes down all the
spiralling,past air
possible, released
can be easy and cold
small traces a single still feather
keeps flying the long hours
of whitening walls, the darkness
so many wires filled
something else
the thermometer
small arm to the window
