Do it yrself 
Now they have two cars to clean
the front and back lawns
blooms in the drought
why not turn the other radio on the
pious hopes of the Red Sox
yes, that's a real gangling kid coming down
the street
he'll grow up
he'll fill out
sponges with handles
we got trinaural hearing
-they are taller than their cars
