It's getting there
outside no brilliant colors but
the winter's landscape
the trees still bare
varieties of each other
themselves neither open nor closed to
the cities of the different world
become smaller, under the snow which spread
in all the routes
by the thin eddying air,
and which turned itself, a partly-visible thing
to drain off, yesterday
there is no sound left
when it started, the curves softening
as the block moves around but the
noise the stone in the gutters
flourishing tunnels
the caves ages to implode, igloos
quickly passed around the hills and the woods
with only a little wind, which is elsewhere
â€”no eyes
and last year's trees
to be washed
behind which is that sky showing through
above the beach
the freeway
shoes
oil
the weather shingles, plate
down for the highway
slum plants, chips,
lanes
racing
exposed
wind, length of the docks
the harbor's teeth
square gas-pump on the corner
disguised (rust-proof
on the way in
the bare trolleys
The tree, swirling, the pitch
into the sky, the twist
from the pitted land, the houses
with easy chairs
steady equipment
the shades
wash
the radio cloud
masses
even in the garden
of gigantic head
sometimes for the moon thick
beer
with the wire gone
over the woods to the sand
the leaf shaking like a cat
newspaper
bundles over itself
the night of dreams
in which we care
walking about
the wind invisible in the picture
the yarns cut off
between the walls
stray beds
and shelves, loose
spades
the ground rasped by a truck or
bulk
It's Heaven when you
have billboards on your men-u .
What's the difference
it's all over
but it's not, it's a
jet trail
which fades out
according to the wind
the tired tread
a segment by the road
where the sun faces
the cape cods and
ranges
with brick steps
or the time thunders
as clean as the new chimneys
sprawling,
bits
everything spread out
and an earthquake is accidental
for all you might care
