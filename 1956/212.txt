S T O A
there is doing and seeing, variety
sometimes you even stop
and closet your eyes there are birds here
1 dark smells which don't lift
meaniningless sound, but both unattached
and continuing in itself
whatever might your thoughts be
whatever it reminds you of
light and darkness, trees
wind roaring there are leaves in autumn
the blowing one way and another
the folded snow is sharp
dirty when it melts
in green brown
the black
days
