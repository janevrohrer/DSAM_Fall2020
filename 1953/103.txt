HINK, READER, IF I DIDN'T WEEP
He saw his own face twisted lunged
in too much of a hurry Who
saw moments of calmness
rough like a rock one came
at times he grew in another place
And one choked like a bird, then looked
(he had strong hair) Was he
superior and opposite
the healthy people
and he couldn't long be neither
hell ,
he moved on
