WATER-PISTOL
The kids are still
talking of flame-throwers
I wonder about
the guided missile
maybe it's used by police
c
Something I won't see
is the tree deep as the branch
And leaves against the sky
while the cat among the cauliflower
sinks in and out, trying
less of a sight
and even two cats
I don't know
the productivity
the man with the limp in back
has suddenly this
new car
but the cat, familiarly
across the yard
or else ease in
the trees, the
birds who don't climb
fallow roof
and the streets, manifold
as if uphill.
