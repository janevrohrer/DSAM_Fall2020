the catch 
the slogans
gone
smiling
below the quick rain
windshields
bound into the sun
again in descent
shines , cave back the cloud
people who
hump the boards
this moment, going
forth, a time
for birds, those
where the leaves themselves are
quieted, after the fall
dancing the table
the whole gutter
of the street
and listen more
again, the birds
ride
within leaves
the openings change
above crickets
come with the moon
a texture
of abutment
