To Depend On Anything is
to Change Parts
Yourself you don't want
to die now though it's happened
but when it comes to the others
leave it to them
you feel bones in reality
and the stones carelessly lying
outside and
rows in the walls
yst the underground has no room for sights
ramming its own shapes
but much as the future changes it
is the plane circling
the future of where we are
touched in the moment
the way you sit there
which the body itself recollects
is something I'm certain of
