Peabody Sq.
Dragged
still
the tall bodies sinister
with their arms back
open chassis
ballfans or
floogie
the well-made trucks
harsh in variety
I saw the way the gull stirred
with his brain
I being the one to sit out
in the car and read
a dog and old lady in a fur
engine
panels going all over the place
the trees were like the Indians
with a round Greek room tangling behind them
(the horse for a weathercock
speed, atop the stables
still further out of the way
the dogs echoing
straight mountain
spasms of sandpaper
the cat folded on the room front
from downhill
and in the middle of the square
the road become a walled land
the birds leaving before
shock of the monument
fast fainting the colors of the air
desolation of gold
gulls rear to the dead
sky
against the turned cloud
under in the wind
past the width of street
my business being to taste the dust
tree and the dry goods
in the stoned glass
and the men with faces
down on the walk 163

To My Mother
so now we have a new bread-box
I face myself in the mirror
metal, the old box
was tall
and I saw nothing in it
