If politics were beautiful the road
overhead close near the gulls
crested so compass wind
and the crooked traffic of this street
one side give on
slow no bike shop
the bloody valley they 
fell back old oval
all the positions
dug up
try
inference
field again
unseen
Sudden
moves also
where was it late for
the sun
again
hy the auto yard
Where the
to acros
shelves have moved
s the street
the
you see a sign
taking room
aound car shoulder
for a Senator in-
cumbent
board in the wind
behind a handlebar
he whistles puckering an
unlit pipe
