from which the strings run
the globe in
pavements to ship's board
what is going on
and my imagination fails
in the room where I was
up the Elevator
that fitted
the plain floor over the Christmas loops
and smoke
in which I lived but didn't come home to
while it was still in my lungs
who, unable
have never touched the stuff
and I remember, earlier at the station
where we were sometimes each day
on that road made with the rest of them
but had never stopped till now
and then moving on
decided not to buy
which I think is on no line with any other
and my head
portion of the air, moving and still
