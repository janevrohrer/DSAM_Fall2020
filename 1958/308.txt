the shadow of the towel three flights up
as the wind moves it
the sun comes out
nowhere, I can see
the crow nest
as if the sparrow talking
planes rattle the teeth
of my home
this month
so many walls
some other blue day
descends into night
the still beach absorbs
searching, a thing that's lost
inland, a number of farms
any of the seasons
A book has a picture of
a warm landscape
(above the rattling pavement)
beside me the lawn
has been plowed up a little
like the garden it used to be
and the grass is around the tree
blade as may be for the apples
leaning, drifting to wastes
tomorrow
a keen, swaying rain
yet to come off
and how does the sun checker
or the leaves lie raked
