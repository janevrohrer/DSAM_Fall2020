street
crowds
speed
delivers
looming
not slow
the clock, if you can hear it
the bad flying weather, through the 
walls, snow 
out
the Window
and that blondie 
the back door where yr dreams go
now the calm of air 
bicycle shingles
up a cellar, past 
there was always something
in this ignorance of music, the scarce breeze
the lifts of the oak, in places green
sleep
over the rain
of hot parts
the plow barges 
in
