A bedouin
the water tank
drippings underneath
camel
the even maze of the desert
rise in a direction
the hills slipping up
out, off light
the way it looks
you might have rain
one of those months
no Palestinian cactus
to reflect a private plane
out near a good home
sawdust and butchery â€¢
shopping
everything snarls, the
toy train
putting them in for hottop
putting in to them hottop
putting in for them a hottop
models get convenient
water tent
maize
