A growing baby. That is Mamma's, that is daddy's
It is summer. a oneâ€”car garage
What will they do in the winter

Well, I'll tell you,They'll play cards
and trade one in
and a fireplace between the house and garage
one in the basement and one upstairs
another baby
in a few summers, as they say
3 cars
