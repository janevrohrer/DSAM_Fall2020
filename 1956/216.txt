against (vertical glass)
The indefinite world,men building bauble
the earth outside passing light
reflected long shutters, vines
cars change
pictures windows summer and winter
lost wind yards
across roads, back
in the woods to the beach water lying in the ground
confuses a muddy paw
springs random joints
excitable fork, at the moment
clams, stick, to china, poles taller than families
even cars make islands from isthmuses
then bays while
somewhere the broken horizons
descend the inner wall
benches in sand or continents
Egypt and the west away from the sea
with genial boundaries
deadly, stinks, honks
of the geese, gulling on wires the
barren preserves,
fish, through
miles ending the world
facing towards the land and the city
reach in its own
pockets like
all fingers gloves police
bank church jail
laundry sand post office
brick courthouse
somehow new in the countryside
seminary behind hilled trees
scrap
heap of paper
smoking leaves
package opens and shut
evening sinks and where
people light inside
the city spreading different directions
to foot the sea
a girl tricycles owlish eyes
