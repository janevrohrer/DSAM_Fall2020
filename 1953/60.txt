& Company
Greetings
As they've got to make
a living. Luxury
and the minutest
Advertising is necessary
Words won't express
How good it is and
really gets
a clef in every kitchen:
At Christmas, Thanksgiving,
The Fourth of July,
Betwixt well-wishers
Multiply
The Split-Pea Freezers,
The Dogmeat Packers
The Slimmest Squeezers
And Traditional Crackers,
The Pickers, Grocers,
Growers, Fishers
to stuff a restaurant
up to yr kisser.
