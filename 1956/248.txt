Cantelli ..
in the shock of flames
roaring cremation
i saw the other people
orchestra
pit
the fine wire
broadcast the
barely existent aisle
with heads of luggage and
tickets , die out
with no thought
or the easter hymn
What happened the forward glance
xn this moment do what is there
his strength iusibeyond
the 32nd quiver wanted
of said bar
how life flashes
and one time
it has no place
look at the sun
the instrument
suddenly for the field
grasshoppers
for other investigation
I suddenly might walk
and might see
the barrel opening horn
one side
even a clearing of ground
yet no cows lying with milk
in a little while
or a smashed hood
under the weeds
