cruel and dark, the city
of all men, close
the window, the
streets remain empty
corner around which to blast
or focus, the earth basements
stone bits
a great garage ceiling
the room lights up
blocked like the heavy sign
paint, interior trees
but specialty is the home
a various momentum
the old office windows
shack the powerhouse
weeds
the station grown with vine
dogâ€™s tongue, causeway
cat angle, hardware
retrieving the lost park
store box with the generations
of color girls
how things have always been eaten
infinity to wires
the work, inconceivable
as it is, each
one is doing his part
dolls ragged on the steps
even the switch is hidden
it's just as well
the Indians had their tents
and a few plugs or cigars
circle children
reading about it
the hot nights slept on cement
the sewer curbs
