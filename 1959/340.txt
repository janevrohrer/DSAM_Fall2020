they say it has seen men die
mute drip of thÂ© snow
become sound
birds
over the unreflective current
long flight for a time
keeling from
focussed against eaves by loop eaves
lighthouse rays
storms in the coast
beat glass high
infinite trees to
clouds huger than the sky
Time sided by lives
but no monkey
big as an elephant
or ape
with a lifetime memory
matted out past the bushes
bear
cat
the events are enough
a few animals, dirt,and the zoo
some feeding it ice-cream
children, who think it ultimately friends
at different moments
the wrinkles not even unconscious smiles
in the wind and
light
where was the zoo when the hurricane
came for those branches
and threw fish on the shore
where did the jungle sail on the
blank and veined earth
