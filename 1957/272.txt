Clouding
over by the tree slant roll above the ridgepile where the
sparrows and dark birds flurried below behind
under the empty blue, close on the roof, wings, back and
come forth,ward feet. Motors cut the lawn, how many types
on one property, man's mitts. Sounds like it was far away.
Already the rain, gone, enough of it, irregular, produced
heavily lengthy aisle screenings,interval yesterday. The
clouds shift to a different frame. There are all lines,
which they cross, and open the bays, leaving, shape.
Cats
and dogs, and more,rove.Around the sky is another view.
Boy, the way yesterday, last year, and two years ago,
three years, cutting the grass, energy of heels up forward
a lot of effort and strain. His costly soles fully visible,
on the slope towards the ranch style, going back
both sides of the brick steps to the basement where the
flowerbeds of whatever plants there are like sills. L
pattern a couple of times. He backs up the width of the
lawn, once all the way, both grass and flag stone, the
waste in these days unfathomable a minute, yet soon, anyway,
he turns around. Then, briefly, guiding angular.
It's a rather small front house, at that. The sparrows in
the air, truncate.
A man comes past with a hard
shine deepily blue boat on two wheels far to the fore of
him, almost wet as it is, holding it by one hand, level
with the wrist, and above that the elbow, and a string.
His duds in there. The greatest morning you can imagine.
HOW are you going to get it through the woods? So it
should be tremendous evening too. It doesn't go in small
packages. It makes the afternoon odd. Sometimes the rain
lowers here.
