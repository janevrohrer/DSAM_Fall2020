Mother's Day Present
Of all the pleasant times in May
Is set aside the fourteenth day,
When everyone has a chance to show.
His gratefulness the best he knows,
To his Mother, who from the very start.
Taught him wisdom from her heart.
Each has his own and separate way
Of greeting Mother on her day.
And though it may be somewhat rough,
I hope this poem is enough.
