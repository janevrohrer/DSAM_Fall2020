shouldering roads, the bedded
impervious shores, the towns
run
for imagination
She should think about her own
miserable grave
how we sit and do nothing she who
the cars are twisted, there was a goat
hill in the zoo, pleasant
days
the grass
bladed
for speeding sight
out to the sun
the bodies we have to name going
through them, the air
fires the dead falling away
every moon, the trees waving
rabbits, the cores of stars
and giants worming the world
the reasonable range
Uranus drinks on its axis
craters, the wearing off days
effortlessly in sleep
the ideas and actions come
novae the chilling light
the sea will steam
outward
would risk
the war
you couldn't
put life together
the fishes
rippled under
follow cow the drive of man
perhaps green the shifted
wall of a room
