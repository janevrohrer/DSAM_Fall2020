back to the rain
ears
or the blurt winds, calmed
by a million faces and the eyes
lost
or go out in the street again
the lines
that keep you dry
beams, curbs
swirl in the gutter
wet laughter died
when you go fast
there is no time
night fades out
as much as day
paling
tree, the house paint as
in the full face of the sea
one might go down the horizon
long
but the eyes dust
it's again a brief shower, like a drink
and the drain, sound, continues
