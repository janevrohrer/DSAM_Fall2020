all these cripples the
ballet
music
is what to do
energy passes
light
lightly
the shaking swan
gives way
something physical
it's a nightmare
like everything else
or the hole in the ground
bombed out
the glassed city
outskirts a gate
and oppressive dripping stars
a witch sabbath
lets up
another night
much in the country
growth
one place
Queen of the maidens
Ah peasants
an unshiftable garden
bush grave
while youâ€™ve seen otherwise
the way things are done
pushing away room
colors and acting
the fancy village square
the hunting party
ah yes
ah yes
how it's familiar
essentially soundless
dawn the incredible end
abandon,to keep dancing
