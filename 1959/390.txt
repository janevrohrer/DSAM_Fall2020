Space!
the space of the corner
imaginable giant
bundle of air in the universe
the burst of fiction
the descent
colors tree in the water
reflecting globes
the heavens empty in a sense
truth varied in some sense
why the thing can be done
upside down for a while
the "lemon" skies
we knew for hundreds of years
the daily "eternity"
signals which leave
windows whole
all the myths 'In the beginning '
were beautiful
thatâ€™s fun, as you know, the
sidestreets flashed by
the children's giants the dogs
To know that we're at
an odd center
yet next morning we've slept
mills fighting
space
