Idea of an impersonal death
the earth
idle seas
so what if there's no
vegetation
rocking on the deck,
just like the arctic
how far
exploration
the idea of distance
stone,
salient
skies
blood
white blue red yellow
what an idea
from Linz to the round
polar bear
the colors of ice
frictionless or weighty
fish
the tendency to keep going
the waste
