tautology or
leaping in the dark, far away
good reason
flashing cats of the sky
arms
thunder
The pigeons walk
and flutter in the spring road
already too fat to fly
and warm their wings
The intent sparrows
could hardly fly in the snow
puling crumbs
Izvestia,the city
let us keep the absolute it's all dark
below the speed of light
in some part of our heads
mastered
all night, behind their lamps, the cars
exhaust the neighboring towns
and the moving villages disappeared
coming back for a while
romance, a long, sustained note
after the full stopped drums
why, let us
like the moon, a thing still here
the ones who need purpose
(in the world
haven't seen very much
then that piano covering time up
things between all the acts
but you can't
tell it
that way
at all it
has to be one finger
294 at least at first
