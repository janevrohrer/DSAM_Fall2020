field, the only place
parked in
shape, so
the air parted, they are quiet enough
now
equipment appears
and becomes standardized
though not yet
one with one light on its shack
the other a long nose with stock, dummy
on each side, strapped,
a roller up front,
the first with a blade underneath
while I donâ€™t know what they're for
the noise they were making
