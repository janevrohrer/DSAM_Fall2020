What history
what you want 
each moment
this is a wall in Spain
jail
the bridge part
of a factory
over the road
what do you care
the bridge swift
crossing
you See longer
residence
seems permanent
Sleep like a flower
in a hospital 
the road
without a break
except
to pine rails
this noon the sun
sky cloudless
only smoke
on a mountain rise
with snow and 
the trees night patches
pockets of one town
the river turn on the street
