F l e c h e . .
cruel arrows gone, the
night closes down,
element, noises
from beyond-the-weather cars
a mental weight death like space
with a little communication?
the clouds level as the earth
as they travel the world
all walls becoming one
the stars induce days of rain
and you can forget ice,
the secrets made by men
are dropped off like shadows
outside the trees waver again
the cold around your bodies
it's curious when to die
