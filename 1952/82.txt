Last night I had the dream
that comes once in about five years
It was a very romantic one;
and I wonder how it starts
we were making
excursions of our own
and I don't know where we were headed
running to basements as matter
-of-factly as curbs
where cheap books might be good
but we didn't quite stop
in the unlikely places
and something else, a
further shaped retreat
and there was a song
sfter that they were singing
I failed to remember
If I live that long
it'll come back
in one form or another
