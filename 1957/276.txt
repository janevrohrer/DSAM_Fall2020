so many things
like running the clock back
dividing
the world, separate
gears
ball and bat, time
we ended up nowhere and went
without looking
and yet all the abstraction of it
the familiar
as it turned out not important
as the unknown, and what mattered
the speck as in
our empty images
memory up and down
waiting to clear away into
sunshine and more streets
or the relieving season of storms
the clock getting it
impregnably in the
wall, interwoven
the silence out of the wind
Driving through, the tricycle in the way 
of the lumbering trucks, bright models
cars and the mysterious
shelved salt, tanks
easily bared, and the figures
which weren't toys, skunks
under the seat, and the possible
legendary mice, and cats
Squirrels
by grandmotherâ€™s attic, to 
look back and cast
nuts, the wise
against walls
the boys tossing the daily
from farther off
