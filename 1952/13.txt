A Wintered Road
Rain and the cold had made the street
Clear, metallic; like a plateâ€™s
Stems, animals, and incident
Held abstract in one element _
Except this was all around.
Out the window, hedge, fence, ground.
Rough reality within
The supernatural discipline.
Maples stood unassuming then.
Frozen water budding them.
Bud piled on bud each opening
Awake to this fierce whitening.
Tall grass, weighed over, matted, lined.
Was tangled in a quick design '
And a stringent thatch of frost
Which let no spore, no seed be lost.
Only the houses and telephone poles
Were ample, wooden, free, almost
Their spring, fall, summer selves. Slack wires
Spaced windless air with their firm layer
And outdoor cripples, elbow-oared
In the road lurched slowly homeward, towards
Where they could witness this alone
And ring up neighbors on the phone.
