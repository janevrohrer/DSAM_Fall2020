P a r e i 1
But I have in my imagination tried
(that, now, at least, behind me
half myself, lifted
over a thing made holy by future nights
the future always going
elsewhere
untouched
while the lamppost steadies the finite wall
the gulls hawk above it
children and cats may cry
and again, out in reality
the unknown car across the river
and she coming in late
and the gulls wheeling
like any man, for a time
may not be
sinister
But I, halted slightly
above
and as much above me
even while the wind blew up as it had done and
the sun traveled
repeating thousands of nights
resolved many lives
