Let all those memories come flooding back.
What of it we may be blown to the moon next week
All I've done is due to my limitations.
I don't care if big cars come down off the trees
with the clouds going away overhead
It is night and morning, the branches reach for gutters
it is raining, the hot metal smells wood
The truth, entirely exact,
is a contradiction
the more you can bear
the more survives
The clouds slake off,and become
uninteresting sea
moment
the sightless shores, farther
life goes on in passing
