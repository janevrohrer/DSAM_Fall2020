As soon as you lay down
to snatch up again
a crime not
history
the guns
silent mouth to the bays
slagged in the sky
no
stinking breach
there are improvisations when
government burns
the purposes
played out like a fiction
at night hanging around
silence the cannon for
slaves are free
and we have joined
to turn home
stars the candles
remembered echoes
bring quiet for
the whiffing against the cold
sawmills afloat
barns impregnable to
iron
the bricks windows anchor
wounded
rifles emptied air
improved aim
in place of propositions
drifted off
the swaying car
is swift
on the streets
picturesque also
the pines are
a straight
backing
mules wires
rakishly light
the stacks take off
it's we uns captured them
today
it ain't fair to a mule
to begin learning im
polite
confusions
with army experience
