Turning
The world of white lies and little sympathies
a level effect
different Snow comes down
or the sun reflects
the jagged spread
stone weeds, wire
but ice crashes
or it drips
glass
footmarks
sound
from the invisible air
metal flashes on
unexpected
the cat crunches
then licks a paw
the sighted main field
glazed
the plant
broken in its earth
and dark smell
a weak support, the dirt-grained
and gaunt leaves
pottery
out of an element
