Do the dogs know why they bark?
something they feel the rain too
over the familiar houses
But they've stopped. Things always slow
the cat's habit of sleep on the roof
at the hole of the bathroom under
the open skylight
take it for granted "Invent" the
cat sleeps on the edge
and the birds he chases have
plenty of space
