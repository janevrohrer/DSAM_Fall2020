theatre " charged with
shapes mountains that loom
names
tined lump surfs ace
black
red
the blinding
from inside clog
Is it at night the smooth
you call for material
which might be abundant
armor for ships
hedge
plunge down rails of
cut sleepers
waters aloud
now farms most of the time
pause anywhere
remember the lines continue
I will be a bee above
the local
I will
if the trees were higher
under the white, or the moon
the sky thrown wide
arms
climbing positions
or through branches
that is a hill july leaves
the western grade
where they grew pigs
riddled as a fence
in delve on suns
and there are generals
of arms
like birds
with captions
there are different speeds
the path
changes
scale
