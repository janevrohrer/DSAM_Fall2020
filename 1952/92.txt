What we saw was a half-clapped roof
the leaves' angle, then the height,
houses that didn't meet
and the hillside skies
for the 1st time
a wood, shale beyond trees
flowing over gables,
and the almost-deadly cats
to make the crossings seem plain
as parks recalled
for ordinary sabbaths
which might change with news
somewhere further than
the boards' fencing, low
or high, surrounding a patched acre,
the drives shallowed by thought
Walking to the edge
or other ends of those streets
by the light plant, where
it smells,
you see it the same difference,
the sky keeps fading
in a whole familiar setting stars
apparently hold still
The dogs troop, scarcely
watching each other
although with experience
going along as quiet
feed,or attracted queerly
to their tails and behind
or tangling flanks, edging
round interminably, they come in
all sizes, and some look wise
but you know why that is.
nobody knows what they think or why
exactly they break and tour here
as if it was a big trip
they happen to come together
at some evident corner, or a distance
near it
they lift a leg screwily
always at an odd moment
as a matter of course, despite all the tonguing they do
to stay dry
admirable efficiency!
and today they've taken it into their heads to run low and raise
hell with the postman
