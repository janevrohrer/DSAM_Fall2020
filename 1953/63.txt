They thought they would eat, but it was a trap
Inside was a room, with table, sink, and stove
but the windows were somewhere else
and the little boy grew piggish
suddenly
but the woman who made it once forgot herself
and the heroine exploded her
Then children mostly danced outdoors
though sheltered from the sun and the moon
