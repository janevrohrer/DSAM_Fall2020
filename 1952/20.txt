A flat-faced dog
with his nose on the groundâ€”
that's my contention
fooling any bone
the unskilled hand
rolling it
one way and another
the eyes crossing
then taking it angrily
a champ between the teeth
or a horse with blinders
tossing cannot
grasp what's behind
everything became nothing
I could not sit still
travelled and saw a thing
close and it disappeared
Almost, I think
I got inside of it
Now the autumn sun
everywhere makes me sleepy
