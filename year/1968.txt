slow
river into
the moon
you forget the heavy
industrious
memory, some
good in itself

the big black car
absorbers pull up
the rain
myriad streets
or these sounds
where the smells freshen
from the earth
the piers hold
and splinter
some boards apart joined
ah, drizzling
the drive together
intersection
point
other corners withdrawn
zig-zags
cannon centuries past
had monstrous mouths
night facing the sea
corbelled wood

A fence by the road-side
a tree
there is
some ploughed land
across from
dark woods
he rides through the low stream
such brown water
the rocks abut
the blue sky whitens 

The world that was, the glass
King King King King
of fashion burst in your eyes
sanitation
men
all the green
over the arm
what's experience, these
... passing time
trudging the newspaper
looks ahead
opens to jaws
academic my
dear
the visibility something
that can happen
does and
the poor wife
couldn't eat supper
how to assemble anything with
flowers in the hair
some kind of accident
Nobel
big shot
on the bus
these
years
back with
the simple song the heart
smoke the
air
outdoors
clouds turn
ever shoot somebody?
—doll in
a mini-skirt
I ran her over
arms
smashed light
what you think of the garbagemen
nesting
under the blue eave
Nothing actually
some great fog noise in the head
I could perform

a toy cart
up-ended, a
begging dog
quiet
birds echoing in
the heat of the day

trees
birds flying like waves
up and down
in the wind walk
the porch rail

marines
futilely
by the skin of their teeth
types
blood
slide
near
here's
the photo
images
form
time
you enter it
far away

white clouds in the sky
far from these birds and green
the most sunshine
empty but still
trashbarrels
back of the porch
lattice
the cool dirt
shadow cast under
clamp puffing quartered cigar
as he mows
the grass
to be odd business
power that's noise

moon 
arithmetic in the night
rain

birds birds 
what little nudes ripping around
feet, feet, feet, feet 
really headed somewhere 
house 
heard carpentry so
unexpected
firecracker made you dribble
july you
get shot
how soon the beach on the way there
a mother calling some kid
by fetishism we 
lose"control" 
(of all the land from to)
wild death, blind as most lives 
make the idol
disintegrate
ourselves
within doors
some hammer and nails
never known how to keep
even the trees
in mind
how long the airports lsat
how long the monasteries
deliberate stillness
in winded birds

beautiful books
again and again it’s
the complicated world

glimpse
of the wailing wall
on the tv
as I went by
through the living room
with a jar of glue

clear-cut shadows
a bicycle by its motion
erect in the street
appeared and disappeared
trees stir in the wind

A bird from somewhere The wind rouses the tree
there is only green in the sunlight
up and
down
nothing
sound ends

the roofer's truck lumber projecting
the seat the shoulder the road
ladders red flags
hands busy more than two
any old radio
tunnel music concerted
voice
fine, uh?
end of a job, ropes
the dashboard there
inside
"take a last look around
to see how it squares

I spend half an hour ringing the bell
there is no door
tongue
moving
nothing at all
a plane twisted
the boy downstairs
voice going up the scale
and a rooster crowed
too early or too late

so many cars
keep the road straight
tossing branches for
the eyes some
leaves adrift
what wind there is
the cars' incessant
noise
like the ocean
distances
bodily
dimensions
smell it
holds together
certain degrees of
the next town the next
junction
it bodes
tomorrow's wonder
more or less pain
the all-night traffic
wakes you up
too much or
often enough
and you keep going
with things the
more it's a
discovery
of change
like what was behind that
brick wall
or fence
not
just an old back yard
like dirt
and bottles but
there were birds
detached passing
and you heard the sea
was there nothing to that?
the lights
almost continuous make
the window a
peculiar corridor
neither long nor short
in no direction

What is
the muscle-bound
in me hides the
consum(mat)or of time
Where
do I send pain Who
can travel light
the inner sides of the tracks

ALL THE EXCITEMENTS
a brand new car
is a brand new car
I'll see it in the morning

he whole round of earth
overlooking
your own back yard
abstract
a geometrical rock
in the various
the sea dripping
mobile at
the sides
faces
to the towering skies
fish and land
creatures ships
symmetry
the sun up and
down light spread
stars rain or a moon
band the silent clouds
a shape to cleave the waves
any
size you can imagine
and made parts
inside are crowds
flatter and flatter
holed distance
arms of a tree

Pain you
shouldn't think of, even
when you have what
shouldn't be there my
numb thumb
such a big bandage a
careless cut
foreign material
chores
lying lightly
to be got through or
enjoyed?
an awful lot
don't puzzle
how you can sleep and
can be the more

roaming the house
something loud where
the wind is outside
the miles down to the beach
any length of time
imagine the extent

the strange the familiar
headlights eyes
we loved riding
the back of the truck
the sleigh on its course
coming down the hill
spilling so many ways
we could never jump
a flying start
it was
always
suppertime
the bells at
sunset
there
the horses
every night the power
sleeps wakes up
in the morning

the mass of leaves is elusive
ungraspable
but they have their substance
even as single things
rain the wind carries
long as it falls
you want to see a man
but what can he say?
it's all in the head
in time has
come together
