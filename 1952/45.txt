State
A drab America, with or without
advertising, is possible
only in this limited century
stand up and take it, don't lie down
Then downtown gloomy
as corner lots beside banks are
on cold evenings
Many
things darken
jazz our classic narrow the network
the foiled bridge the drama
the static press gray monument
heavy between blind piers
polared and holed-up
the deck so ended
(river-drowning
not daily be pronounced as history
69
ALTER yr
with the light Blindness lifted
Day remind me of all
26 years
you were nothing,you
your parts had not come together
yet
through the bodies of others
they were dying and dead
and they did not even have to think about
and to all intents not possible
incapable
and much matter passed and I
have grown while talking
(surprise balloons
and I can no longer see anything much
without lying
although before there were many positions
much gone
to remember, thinking
(one foot after another foot
one oak after two houses, one
wind after five yards and
those that circle the world
the stars
down to us
before and beyond, in the middle,
us, who have seen, to have us
with us
and it is their privilege
we are unable to get there
Mars, after years of it
Venus Saturnia
And I saw them going
in the hard light
Which was also a little weak, disappearing
straying, below still silently
ohm, seen from the bulb
above the stoop, gaping
round, and weak, and the force
outside of dark places
dying out by steps
and those men, streaming
ghosts and the arbor freshened
springs capsules
precise water
or the side tops shone
the light kitchened the smiling present
abundantly like the tidy inviting trains
but into the plot a resting place
I then mistook the moon
for a different headlight
near the corner cutting my actual sight
At the time, this park was a livingroom, the people, trees,
and without leaving any roads between them
myself on the outskirts
and the fir tree went over the house
