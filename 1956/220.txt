pretense of horror, till horror
comes, confused
but uncomplicated and demanding
there is no reason
for it, you don't know when
Suffering or remorse is
better taken away
for it makes a difference
no matter who keeps alive
though as before, in pain, it is me
still blinded, the sun
now on the floor
bones giving off memory
