The amazement of these cripples around me
at a few words, unable
in my feet and so forth, ah
truly beautiful voice
for its own sake
the boat back and forth 
for every lightning there is thunder
forth I say, when the storm comes up o!
woman lacing the land
terrific, somebody says
say how about the water, is somebody’s chip in
think we might be in a dangerous spot
sure, wonder
how can these rods take it
well, maybe we’re caught but we're movin, too
the slow sun is winning
