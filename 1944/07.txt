Candle
Silently rise, O Star
To meet the falling night,
Lend to the face of peace
A spirit light.
That, through the open air
Beyond the sun.
Dreams may be dropped from heaven.
And I catch one.

THE POLE BLUES
Slivers caught my knees, alas,
I crept on the piazza floor,
I crept in the bony yard,
but I wanted to get some more
I crept across the road
since I wanted to shinny a tree.
Once I got to the branches
I should climb ingeniously
I crept down at the shore.
Stones between water and sand,
I started digging to China
Right the middle of the land
Dirt under the grass,
my pants on the piazza floor,
I crept in the bony yard.
Though it won't go any more
