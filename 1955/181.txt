Age
The street was a hall
Lairs in the mountain chain
the weather shifted over
and replaced
the lions or goats climb the ridge
windows admit sun
the earth is still plain
under the feet on the ground floor
clouds enter, moving
at a distance, the great doors
Lead in and out to the sky
rhe little paths across the earth
A woman at the corner sells fruit
Do not put fish on the ceiling
but low in the walls
With the hunt
After you have eaten
