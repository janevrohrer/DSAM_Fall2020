the trees of deer
brushing leafage
man occupied by
giraffe the jaw
horrible things
he is
storehouse in bark
sing off top of a drum
surviving branches
button button the
tail white through the thick
tall clouds now
look, their bottom
opened, you lose, smell
the updraft of metal
What's insight to the eagle bare wind
shadows
fall a long way
take arms in their flight trees
turn a little
off
hull strands among leaves
birds nest small strokes more power
in the rain
the sun lap from a wall
stars through it
makes no difference
