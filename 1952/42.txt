North
the leaves headed green
already in mouth surfaces
I can't see reflect
the sun from where the sunlight strikes
all of color/ the
spots are indefinite; but
the parts alter
there is always a sun to some leaf
and as well shadow is everywhere
the sun alters a
vivid and light spray
shot half a block from an already
dark hill
there are all kinds of leaves and
as before there was not one
they do not space themselves
we have the moon which rises
soon enough
and variously.
the sun having a long ray
one by one and 4 corners
eight misshapen corners
and sixteen hiding behind
the leaves
is still
far from the spiders
