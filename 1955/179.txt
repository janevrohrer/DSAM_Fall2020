Gathering Noon
Only the outdoors
and from inside the building
the lights
come on the streets
tragedy for damage
others you see
in the living rooms
out the night as the stars
closer apart
and what may be in their minds
is a different ordering
as before,
the causes of their positions
so, somewhere, are the clocks they have brought
to be restful
and the freely-progressing cats
they accompany with their eyes
They inevitably go to the bad too
but the trees end off at the sky
and it would be a good thing
to pass, even
our own goal
till dawn shuts them out
and we keep more behind this
way, our yard
