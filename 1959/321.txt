motor around
the sky and
caterpillar
bumps of(f the road
the woman a tree
standing
leaves of
a basket
dying or green
he clips backwards
with
electricity
enough so you're confident
to be aware
packed like the gutters
splice pilings level through the air
the great
world at the window
stirs with the breeze
smell onwards seasons
to the cold storms
baffering air
tides of spring
the flowers
and stars
have opposite names
