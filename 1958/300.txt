a virgin
don't realize what a
fine thing is the ceiling only
when I get used to it
when I go to sleep there's the sky
lighted
around the shade
it takes experience
that close-fitting night
shops, for
the country flourishes
the street should go on
and daylight's down on the floor
as well as the giving earth
one wall has a reproduction
of the sea, and green land
behind her a rock,
but far enough
to let it through like sound
and that's the thing that comes back
because a sound is soft
the child on the face of a table
her right shoulder passed
before some cloth fold
egypt or Italy
