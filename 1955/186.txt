NOW AUGUST
The rain is partly a hurricane
some south
on approach
realize
how far
it is come
south
the wind bulges
and the storms fly
to New Hampshire
clouds
the weather's reported
for once, again,
the pennant called off
the pavement
in New York
where none might be
no lightning
a violent thunder
two days ago
by the sea, waste
night getting wet and
disspant
