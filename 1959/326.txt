Thinking bravely
in bed
no longer possible
interest
everything that happens
by mechanical means, actually
(but not mechanical)
we can now hear
out there, the speed
of 2 syllables
the second, so
bound up it is spinning
the heavy globe
this
our ears, energy
of paint
a plane interferes
from overhead
what was there to learn
but to die
however we come to it
the big plane
or is it the common weather
lumbering over
no longer the cut ceiling
the out of range
while you read
Boccaccio
a falling off
or Handel, some mistake
for the years
until the water
music
the years are lost, you may come
sufficiently
back on that sound
I heard the giant pianos dragging out
Rameau and Mozart fierce ghosts
the deaf man
books hours
