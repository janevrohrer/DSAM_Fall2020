Swivel a figure
of two minds
chattering legs
suddenly on
a complete room
struck
air, the present
Some law becomes
in the line of things
they made themselves
Waking the beach
and then touch hands
away from the blank walls
the tremor of waves
it's no bird's
skirt
the other leg tip
silence to its level
the sea is fading
he has carried her
bundled pitched
downward
to hold
man
who must be moved
and she tumbles from him
running out wide
