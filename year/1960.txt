like those bad heads
children have
idea
of the connection
funny
if you stand
under
voices
one end is at the right
and piles
been through a screen
starting sounds
/
familiar tides
single shores
towards night
and steady cold animals
get through the woods
relaxed heads
individual
old man
dream echoes
some increase the vibration
looked into by flies

the knowledge of death, and now
knowledge of the stars
there is one end
and the endless
Room at the center
passage /in no time
a rail thickets hills grass

blades of grass
under the miles
along air
the missile
is a failure
birds rush
and their thirst like water

and the outboards
leaving you empty
fall to sleep
still children next day
always plenty to
dream
the bouncing spray
the walls are
loose really
your hands
you take to sea
the mute
clouds
file in the wind
the root wet
from clean clothes

the trees stand in the wind
the sea an inversion
roaring,other places the branches
heeled
out front of the flagpole
the attics of houses
up the hill, cradles
emptied in this light
breast
of a million arms
snow gone from the ground
the cars pass off in the wind
wires dancing at walls
cool clouds silence the flow

o cloud
tons of snow /and power
lines
a big truck
to match this
and the inarticulate
spread of wind
down grade
the sudden world
in a heap
a dog floundering
you resort to skis
the day will move

loneliness, existence
this is the fine flower and
the bodies in a ring
the geometry
some substance given the stuff of
the earth,imitable
air
the graces in a car
gun
and exhaust the word is familiar now and the curves
perfect as straight lines
Barefoot to match
the atmosphere, a
plain for the distance, the
slung horizon

The cats like children
(do push-up) come have supper The Little League
shouting in unison at
boot training I hadn't looked at the ground
for a while
no more exhausted
than it was patches
of that big snow, since
weeks have passed it was
an unusual depth, the
long lines, and the thought how
nothing would stay much
It came almost to the windows or
far enough Others
to halt the mind We do not beware of the cold
from memory, except
when far gone The horizon
is not there
bicycle spills it
wasn't a joke He got some pain
candy in his face also, it might have been his last,
he picks up and rides on That is where
you stretch and get bigger
The temperature
went up and down;
a few weeks The tree-stump alive
in front of me Children
come in, men
eaters Cats
have outlasted threads, reflections
stopped in the night to be
baled by the sun

on street
and they all
wave to me
when I sit out there

it is music he
become 5 men
in a line
nor any man
to see time,
delight of the mind
in time, the
harmony
at once, going
a jungle, strange more
performance with the lips

briefly
again
the sun faint or
bright on the
tree's bark
and the air a sea
where the branches bay
close part some birds
stream enough
and sound through
boats too

Why do they have two elevators? to

dimension of the sky
vagueness, where it begins
the sun rises
into the 9th floor
clean parts of the city
glass for
maintenance smoke
through the level of birds flat roofs
different from window-sills

those crooked houses
the way standing
the sky packs clouds, mute
like summer ice
stream of trees
wreathing to the ear
a bird in
the porch and over
the next roof
by
the least curve
tangent
as beyond a nest a

edge-piece
steepened leaves

a sure place
blue and now
anything might wait
over the line
and now
a little to the side
it's like the zenith
that purple of
stars the sun as slow

Asphalt
hello joe
where you go
it's a little neat
in the paving heat
did you ever stand
a multiplicand
what is the slate
you anticipate
joe cratz
if you never ply 
i ask you why 
your ducking feet
should be a treat

The surgical waters, every 5 days
a plane goes over
Is anybody dying? I
don't know. Death or life
the pipes on a wall, cream moldings
Differences the whirr
in being sick
moments on the window-sill
the lives of the pigeons
next door in the day
hammering
piles

the steep town
part through hills
split day
season
with a gun
the tree shock
a lane
and the field a hospital
efficiently into the air
the heat
passes and
has come again
the beating down
of the quieting
insect
no more towers
a prostrate eye
terrors may
be in the sky
night's wet
level
stalks
pressed row of pain
a safe high
part inside
displaces
the shambles
nice
shelving of earth
plates
the ships
of the surface
and flags

the traffic reach by
hospitals the
corridors the patients
exert through
rooms at
some elevation
glimpsing and
keeping on some easily the
trailer-truck driver the
retired cop already
a little heart the
soldiers
a schoolgirl smiles looking in
as if searching the window
a few days
then finally stops

Screaming woman
o god god please god
beyond wall angles
my last night
a further
reminder expected now I go home wherever
it is Enough plenty
changing of sheets these
beds high
The double sashes open
minutes balmy outside
and times the city lay bright
autumn as
tenacious buildings smoke
wooden and back up the hill
old houses with trees
heads green bent as some grass
all a
mounting of the sky the town again
through the facing window oars
lengthen one pane duplicate
possibilities an ice age, say,
or storms of this level a twister
from land or sea might top
these 4 arms,earth
and others in life to
keep the pigeons from
that side and a schoolgirl
who peered in
the both of us with a
surgical wound i used
to be sick felt
death mounting cool fissure since
nice waters how
you get through with time
the day
crossed unending
by night the two pipes
down the green wall
oxygen suction
who thought
the beds
the interior decorator
the architects ?
green 30 years

They would not rent or sell the
building crumbles now
a fashion in the snow
fine flakes down all the
spiralling,past air
possible, released
bird can be easy and cold
small traces a single still feather
keeps flying the long hours
of whitening walls, the darkness
so many wires filled
something else
the thermometer
small arm to the window

the doctors dress up ,
the patients in their pajamas
so much
to go on
it's funny when somebody dies
or you wake up from a fine sleep
between walls the light
to give
blankness in shadow
this time your water is golden
I smell like a bad wing
about to die maybe I
who could do nothing about it
