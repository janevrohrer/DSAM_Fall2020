rained
the wind blowing bulkheads before the windows
when I heard the surf where I hadn't been
for three years'pouring
the dark was nothing
And shut my eyes in piles in images
and streams from the bay's fury
bottling me
walled, and even willows over the roads
and yet a cat's cry was like a gull's
crooning and I couldn't sleep
sleepily turning Then
I found a thing had given birth
