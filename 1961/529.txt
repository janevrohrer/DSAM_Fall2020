one dog barks
years
calendar come down
pictures
with trees, ringing
air
Perennial sun, grass
Vibrant beds pack shadows
the same partly out
the morning though you might not live again to
summer
thought has come back
you consider to burn oil
but seasons casting moments
heavy trucks
speed against cold
all the seasons light sky, smoke
hills blue past a river
the spark of oil night wires
the rising trees walls clouds
stream above various green
