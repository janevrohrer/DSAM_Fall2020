Place
below the sheep may be
growing into their dream
Above they may be mating
(like
this an escalating shaft this
the light-retired ceiling
or taking socks off
setting
already there
time's
something
for the mind
out
then occupied
There was a story once my father lay
on the apartment's roof
when after marriage they used to rent
before getting to
their own flats on the edge
If he
turned in his sleep he
would pass all these
And there was a slight tremor that night too
something in these
parts rare
