ALTERNATIONS OF INFINITE
BIRDS
the sun changes, here in slowness
perceptible winter
when some side in the ground
and some do not know, silence
which may be summer, winds
the fine
clocks become
useless in the world, profuse, the green
to burn up alive night
stones, the moody glaze, and not
catch sunrise
even in winter
bound
the road
patient
forms the seasons have tried
and earth
varied by
the drunk rain
