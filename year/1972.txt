history
romance
by the leaping
fires 
of

Looked like she was roller-skating
while it rained
the sidewalk
full of reflections
I imagined it close

Many lives
budding ahead of
us
the tree
branches enough
the leaves
fall out
on the wind

It looks nice in the snow
getting lost
where I used to get lost

the moon
in
the
sky
after visiting
the wire
the wind flows

thick snow
in the air
merges time
on the ground
it keeps on
the earth holds

driftwood
the sands
a tree spreads
dirt is
hard grains

Hide and seek
Indian
cops robbers the
walls waning
steady
paint
verticals
hard to see
corners
the wind
leaves
the sun
ladders
pot ragged
what days
scaffolding
hung too much
to watch
all sides
of men brushes
weigh locks
flat plane
then cloud
damp air
and there's sandwi
chilly
at the beach
seasons
perceptible clock
the lee
shifts
the windows
the weather
pole flag vane
across the street
the shadow sucked through rapidly
at noon
the trees are so high
the sun tangled
but we have a firetruck
really resistant stone

Take it
every atom of me
belongs to you
across distances
one space
a photograph of a dam
or a morgue
or hospital
or anything
on its side

years are
wood
staircases
the same
public buildings
have some guts
in the wind
so many ships
again on
the horizon
radical designs
you see them change

shape
shadow
elements
move
paper
tar

anything
has to be easy enough
to get done

single
notes
sung

zigzags outline
the
n dimensions
the world
far corners
itself
life

room
for flowers
shaft
the air
winds
move
dimensions
distances
directions

place to place
well
life is
moving
like the wind
now
blowy
vacuum and weight
anything
at all there
see mountain
shoulders, confusion
crowds of men
borne away
when you slow down there's sound
the ropes buffeted
against the flagstaffs
rest area
many placards
and walls hold
gravelly like rain
it may be dust
at
the base of the car 
vacation
cabins
in the morning
all over
you realize
the trees above tall
swaying
steep up the hill lines
there's a good view
a road sign later
fast you can stop
and eat
it's motionless enough
and the sunshine
a bicyclist along the way
changing

advancing
rain
with the wind
in the leaves

the mica clean on
the walk
various complications
everywhere the light is
part of the sun
by day
the stars are invisible
from stillness
the air waked
gold coal water gas which turns
earth stripped
we change
each other

in the trees
the strength of cross
winds
and then sunlight

in the shadow
cross
winds
sunlight

The days the motors burn past
the houses , under the trees
repair smoke your
shingles
all grade 5 on
the beach trip in a bunch
teachers
whistle
steady
heat
slow
map
calendars
if you see it
might be
easy
how
anyone works
in the haze

Now
the eclipse
traffic
bicycle
the night rise
in
one space

perfect
strangers, dining
in the air together
tossed out
the window the world
Gluttony deeper
Lust
as plate keeps
precarious
trays in
and there are
delicates still
areas such
foot travel
aisles lead
ramp taxi
foundations off
cats turning
alleys
to sleep
in
light the
earth seems
to run
gotta go
â–  ta la
most things
roam legs
novel experience
get stuck
vertical direction
make and break
distances
smelly roofs
ride over
to the walls raised the
works
face people, their panes, the poor
food brought through the mouth
dichotomy
young
old
around
where
gunmen
deflect
bound to drown
enough
stakes other
fantastic
sums
out of mind
tend to your business

How you
stand
for your
self
one quarter
the muscles
the face
mouth
changes

wheels
familiar
turned
light
front
roots
streets
a kitten
stretching
in the grass
sun off dirt
you can't see stars
wires
kept running
in places distance
gives out
moving
the sea
so many circles
you leave traces
birds that pass
imagine the wind
through green leaves
the sky brought near
open full
silent branches crossed

along walls
reached you
figure things
the solid
the group
life
span
the world where
energy goes out
binds
displaced
settling
near and far
develop touch
the wide awake

how much a squirrel is
in the road knocked dead
the same generations they
going around the wires
up the pole
down the tree
not leaves
call
the
patrol wagon
after how little blood
from far away slow
an action of your mind
is to take your time
when does the sun come out
or it's dark back in the woods

glass
by glass
also wood
you look out
light
and metal
crossings up
wind
head-on
for
years
the streets were lonely
always
some death in them
now what
ever there is
so many thoughts
to accept

HOTRODS
SO the same
space
there houses
as the day's
quiet

how much could they
flicker
pull down
the shades on them
the lights burning
night
distance

another plane is
gas far, a lot, the night
shadows too
the fish tank bubbles
everything stand
continue shapes

things more or less
in a Yogi's dream
voluntary

reticent
being
stand
the lamp
by the window
it's the rear face
of the corner house
far off, the sky
darkening
big trees, tops wild
space look
direction
some time of air

finishing
touch
the door
painted
again
shiny
sun
spread out
afternoon

various ways
streets hold
momentarily each
tinderbox familiar
infinite windows
the fear of the cost of false alarms
rays of the telegraph
moonlight
old south church
pulled through
the past like a fiction
nearby
the park we walked
cross there
water
100 years
there was grass

open road
you look in houses
and the night sky
any place
is all one
this time

how much the moon may be
the wind
different
places
thinking
men forms
variously
size
the thickness
like statues
out back
round earth
machines
square miles
between poles
imagine
upside down
Polynesia
caves
radio track
dishes
to hear dim stars
the sky a field
sheep
horses
mines
cities everywhere
on the eyeballs
particles
deserts
streams
the oceans curve
piss, for one thing
to make things go

curtains
shades
the ocean
and the sky
both deep
hills
