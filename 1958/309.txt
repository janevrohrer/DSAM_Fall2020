future
open the beyond
underworld exits and entrances
the smoke going up among the stars
shivering ware
in Athens the dust
and elsewhere a pine and
oak
dusty olives
in the sea green
Wind
is a strong man
ichor is blood
on the ground
what dies must be born, they said
to drink
memory after
forgetfulness
raise up the dead he's a
machine
walking so stiffly
both sleeping and awake
in its junction the soul
had memory to go by
