he sky is empty, and through
the full trees, outside
where I have walked, being
unable to retain
heart for the hands and eyes
or swayed buff of the seas
cars, heads on
wherever they go
trains, too, the dwellings
elsewhere, past the wind, ground
secured, beachless, lights
matching stars that fall
along some interior and
out
or now I come back on
a silent grass unimportant
that I forgot nothing
to matter it has
impressions of
the body
in the sun, say but here
is night
there is weird
gaps of light
the still
unfamiliar
reflected
on branches likewise
