March,
sparrow twittering in the snow
the empty and the full
window on the fall
the partially bare floor
is what I like, under
my feet the cellar melts
It is near freezing along the ground
the car fusing the dog barks
the phone cries dying creation
raised trunks doors
in light houses behind the screens
the birds holding the air with their crumbs
streets the sky over and over again
wedges and tolling packs of sound
Night. Everything falls flat
The dump of the world. Even within gravity?
the cold. There is a woman
playing piano we do not see color country?
for some space There were green trees?
The houses were farminghouses. The
simple as a road. The ceiling is w i
And somewhere now clouds leave the sky
Look at it? the keyboard's marking tiro
inside like a harp something
breakable, it's as if eternal
the thing drags out? had to be
a long time back she remembers the
this
in FRance. There will be some years
After last year
she wears
at. least in giving a study# patien
echoes leaves? distantly
blocking the window dark
in the broau
at the muffed room
