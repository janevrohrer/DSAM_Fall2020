Because the faee fades from yaur rtiind
Mostly your own face, that is why it is new
these times you face it, in that sense new
and you hold on in a sense
ever leave go
on the walk, you here fixed
fallen on your nose, know
any production of a tree
however strong it is Once in the movie
Light was an art, faces became stamps
but even they faded luckily
so that they contracted into vagueness
after all including the clock's face
moving the wall, only the clock with its facet,
in the mind's dark made light of, back of the eyes
the back of the mind unweighted but pulsing
like its latest discovery, built by hands,
put to no future use
