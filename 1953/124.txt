THE HOLLOW ROAR
by the sea is
the autumn piecings
winter, the high-school
stood on its feet, bleach
in season
it is an increase in the traffic
from some sort of silence
yet I think of the sky
something invisible
flying in or against nothing
yelling for the sake of yelling
in back of the waterfront
but a drop of rain is quiet
the spread-out shore
the shell
picked up sound
become mythical
and dimmed too
actually it has the wave's curb
or from far away ((the teeth))
hard baby
the present
men the children
paying no atention to the game
)
the wind is a tug
the slip of a sign
