the figures, lines
hidden
toots and rivers
the under
turn up
beyond cables
and offices
cutting the air, stream
thin space
the sides shown
the ghostly tongues
of water finer edged
than the mud flats
flowering
into your streets
palpable
times, the snarl
oneness, legumes
of ripped loam, swirling,
Proliferant planes, impressions,
headlong to zero
a light mouth
an open bay
