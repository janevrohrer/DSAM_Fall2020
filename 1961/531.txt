Animal hospital
the garage
tail
your nose your throat your mouth your
sleep hair
eight hours
shift in the windows
sun cars below like
minutes flashing
my half cellar 
easy floor of the barber's
the coliection
cut off
the ice, natural
studied 
a
steady customer
of yours
a couple miles away
to go by
play at , no hand
ball 
your whistle
business
machine
runners of
your Windows snapping a little perhaps
in different airs
the sharp winds of anesthetic
strayed
slope like the day
death without pain
some having it
now permanent 
from sleep
without thinking
of the last
twig, post
