snow makes a slow season
however varying , cold
shifting, remaining
clocks move
different circles
gulls huge among the airy
roofs hemmed out
maneuvering
weight seems to
loom and stalk
they
won't be far
wherever
winter goes

co-op
wind
ows a
door

Can't hold
both hands
fine print
never mind

birds the
warmest blood in the world
keeps hopping
powerful breath a ground
target while brooding
the
positions
man' s
growth precarious birth
to soar in the mind
so big to the earth
whole parting
active wake
all the dimensions
a great head of

the radiator
simmers
down
after a few years
it's quiet
it's almost dawn
how cool may the night be

intersections of forms
areal
the world's parts move
a magical shape
in out of
all
so cloudy
is change
fog is gone
leaving the ground
rain drops
the sun penetrates
certain things
though some slide off

churchbells
years ago
minutes
while storms of men, say,
last night, some
freshness of tack,
not to believe,
nothing but war
is war, exhaustive
death, a wind
rain, starlight's gone
blue, nothing alone, birds sing

imagine you see rain
dark place
and wind
on a bright day

crossed self hand and foot re strained
abstraction
in the dark

or how much to
live
how many
times
breathe
to decide death
besides life at
what time
slips by
the sun and moon, all
their distances
may fill our minds yet
what corners
can you run free in
how much do we
have to know
for the habit of hours

All matter
standing
build up
wave to wave

good and bad
time goes
leaves changing shadows
the wind fails what paths
I fight nothing
there are no weapons
separate clouds
traveling in the years
the sun, depths,
varying, mass

the window opening
no, already opened
nothing but the wind up

My god the
proverbial
we drive in
and
all are mowing the lawn
trimming
snip snip
the firetruck
this distance
scream
my town a giant
place
embank
the day of the party
trees in the wind

The imagined, returning
what is
endless song


spraying up
the tree
down
wind sounds
the straight no
mix
clear water to the eyes
it may be a wet
bird
elsewhere time later how
to work
singing
through
tough branches
space
they keep in the years everywhere
various quiet like the sky
a steady plane moves

I saw a squirrel
I might be
those two kids
I saw
a cat
both
on the ground
there were different
sky and trees
flights sounds

I ride I
don't believe in planes
what purpose there is
various principles
tremendous craft
until my end
the surface gets easy
infinite air circuits
merging
clouds like our wing
out the lined window
maximum length every
light spreads
 
typing
clicks
no open window
in sight
a while
the weather
hot brilliant
fire-escape
as we say, the air
filled with light
blinds down

rain
curtain
birds and
thunder
You ride for some hours
stalagmites
clouds cities

Yes, it's
liquor
I smelled
that breath
nothing
lost

cars arrowing
increasing traffic
each way
by
the funeral
home
daytime
hour by hour

a temporary language
as temporary things
and poetry the
math.. of
everyday
life
what time
Of the day is it
lad what
have you
to do with
or gotten
done

D Gitin
spread-out constellations
dark
areas
all
together
far and near
points

after
Shiki
Coming to see the cherries
he had his money-bags stolen
it's too bad
the man from the country
October
the moon shining
deep
air
waters
dreams
stirred-up
leaf shadows


Quiet grass
after Basho
still air
rocks
the locust
cries

after
Basho
unknown
tree
flower
scent
"I cannot see what flowers are at my feet
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs.
But"
--said John Keats

Don't cut
time to pieces
Let it stand
inside invisible
again and again
it will work as it happens
your eyes open

a dark day
all this time
clouds
birds in
the air
and it rains
trees
a few leaves
with
stand
