Come out of your eyes the
soul is a corner
universe
back two steps
now you're shadowing walls
broken into houses
carry the ground
eternal spaces
weeds
the sun turns west
you are what I am the empty flat
has clean sills still
been taken
that dog
is younger than you
memory is less, not so crowded
as the trees are
slightly, the earth is changing
as much
you remember the papers
the dim place
the branch held by the attic
it's a lengthy view
night coming
tomorrow
the sun to divide
and suppose the rain
shadow going down
in one window and
out of another
