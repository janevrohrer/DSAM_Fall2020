Smoothe pictures
on the open air
dirt blown around
shingle
distance the corners of windows
wandering
the shoe builds
nails keep length
cars forge through
slips
of stone
left behind
the moment
invisible
to consider
another
this the
sky having
the map cloud
and the clear sea
we meet
the radio clashes
now we've traveled
the sun is fresh
a number of times
back where the chickens cry
and head-right dogs
a good errand
to groceries
to see the sun rise
and disappear
again again
timing
the minute shapes
shiftless enough
you know my friend died
he was driving today
