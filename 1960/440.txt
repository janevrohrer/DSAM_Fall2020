Aw
You're all right
Look at me
there seems to be nothing
in which a gull flies
we spoke french differently
but english to perfection
the gull in the puddle
fascinating
windows, the sun passes
a warm cloud
you know sticks they
collected em dry
to keep the mind off the walls
the windows into the
far away
flashed pain, time,
slivers, never to stop
