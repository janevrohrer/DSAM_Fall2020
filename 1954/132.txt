it takes time to walk
around the corner of the house
and throw away the stone
if it didn't
time would be a problem
I accept time,/involved
as I accept the clouds
and the houses
and the water regarding which
I am bedazzled
making reality dream-like
and bright field
continent
I realize I've
got to make moves
even if I don't
