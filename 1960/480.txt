visiting yesterday
today burying
half an hour
out
death part of life
because it's strange it makes
the sun yield
stars swamped by the day
the night open
wind
and cars roll
blankets outside
lawns
the past wanders
how many people
along brief buildings
lights
in all waters
that you should see
the mist warm
on metal the snow
wets moss
of the sweated wall
that the ground, spooks,
and uneven
the buildings cast shadows
even as the bakery
its smell
and the tree next door
is close
It grows dissolve
the wind
turn around
in the air
