A Child Thought, Man, A
Clothespin Animal
By-pass: the deserts
the emptiness oxen broke into
trying to swallow it
Inhaling salts
the man-trap mountains in which they dragged
theirs, over peaks
restless, impaled
Those men, fitter than you, flying
through inescapable rain must have remembered
pure dust in the eyes
Peaceful Pueblo were Communist
Men and infants come a long distance
the Romany Sioux thought them a joke
reliant and knowing nothing
Plenty
had grandchildren
Belly-aches, two precarious legs
strung high, but we have passed around the world
The Sparkplug, dead, the train, being stopped by snow
press on a different way. Danger
quite catches us, practically too much
reality shocks see stillness
here again
the plane
lost in the dark, suddenly we drop
into a bedroom we didn't think of
instantaneously
a man is failing
but believe you are safe
(that is the only thing
