how many times
have I been here now

birdsong
back of the head
cloud
tree
branch
twig
leaves
street
fixtures
litter
trash
debris
a rake
forest
paper
barrels
sound
traffic
in the wind
endless the world
turned round
so the sun
the same
variety
like all
the news
there is
to be
heard
to know

deadly enough
hurt deaf
heavens sworn
to torture it’s
turned out compelled
enough ?
a few years past
good
other times
daily good
father like
on the playground
nearby
why
remember
why
how much
compulsion
why
fight the end back
what
kind of life
for young and/or old
to have value why
question
lead skies
ghastly trees
why
seemingly endless why
the torturers
how much
is there
pain -
fulness
why
cry
out
what's
any difference
between us
to see
why
ask
when there's time
if there’s time
on account of there's time
to spare
in
our time
to be
after seeing "Chronicle of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising According to Marek
Edelman" directed by Jolanta Dylewska
(Poland, 1983) 

slight
of a size
air
possible
a tree
to live
stirs
at rest
out
a while
the window
soon
while there's so much
on round
after I've
waked up
earth, sky
to start
the morning
) birds too
about as quiet
there have
as flowers I see
been times

days / deeds
t Days of
the Dead
in Mexico ♦
nothing shd be dead, changed
as much
as all
that if
anything's dancing

special
moments
lots
of time
sight
worlds, sunned
dust, motes, storm, grain
(in magic
amber
genes
in
old bugs
provisions
sound, feel,
taste, smell

cold nights
if you sleep alone
you can double up
