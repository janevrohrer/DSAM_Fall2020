so what if mankind dies?
the birds
the croak and whistle
has no future, either
so what?
so what?
the future arrives
the end of a stick
in my crotch
toward the speed of light
over dead man or a living woman
or eating bone
and in the day-time might be seen
who walks the street
they went clean-eyed through
the nights
swam in the ocean
the disappearing bay
the green air for fish
lanes of expensive God
corners out of the sky
and carried the dripping roads
into the allies and piles
such walls forming the ground
at a straight beat
clang entrance
taking the idle air
even figuring time
which before goes by itself
