Le Marchand
Let there be pretended trouble
Portia's mad
dress as a boy
to tell tall stories
after marriage
to be on the spot
to the end
but then to bed
How would she sleep in those inns
Courted"by strange men
became vital
by a trick
the Jew converted
no more gripes
so shines a good deed but
the Jewess well schooled
in the nature of Thisbe
a little shrewed
the nice man taught her
Platoâ€™s myth
of Shylock no more but
what did his friend say
the importance of sincerity?
