Nice and Tasty Meals, say
time and again they're
all over

All the matter of
Vive 
From real wild swings to
The static
Times are the same or
Differ
Without motion
There'd be some place as cold as small
As you might think

To jo in sleep some day
with birdsong
out the window
or at night the breeze
with stars shining
rain, cloud


To go in sleep some day
with birdsong
out the window
or at night the breeze
with stars shining
rain, cloud
