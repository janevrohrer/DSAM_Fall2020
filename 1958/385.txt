cress
figure ruts in the street
battery light
Xmas
will show this up all night
endless,
open the sun
tilting, like the earth, country
glass, and hills. shadow
the grown human
town
exhausts, the busses
at a grand canyon
shopping center,
for Hallowe'en
and hot August, almost lost out of its
park, level remote edges
the cities under all clouds
the trucks in the night are blind
except for their lights
the road is still dark
