the sguirrel trying this tree again
sharp
the wind out,here
through the glass
pumpkin light the leaves
in lop their
moments now the world
verge over at the great
and next a nearly bare branch
shadowy still
up some strip of the sun
turned a little
off and
later the bird
a black pond
to
for the wings
go away
after a nest was
there
