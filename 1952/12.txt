This car goes under the bridge
This car goes over
This car goes over the bridge
Where the houses rest
to where houses rest
stop and romance is lost
Stop and ro-mance is lost
each car stops one place
each car stops in one place
But the illusion of speed
is keeping place
How nicely thy tents
How nicely thy tents
How beautiful thy empties
How beautiful thy empties
The white lines by the plant
The plant by the white strips
The white strips by the plant
The towers by the lines
This car sees the bridge
This one sees the bridge
This car goes over the bridge
