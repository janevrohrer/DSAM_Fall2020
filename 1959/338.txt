Rind
under these conditions, does sleep
laugh
more and more slowly
should memory be how the moon
comes up somewhere,
everywhere, now the red
with its direct lines
Arles
the room full
of slightly bamboo
things
and innocent
monsters
where I have dreamt myself
a mausoleum
is deep enough
so you could stop
thinking the sun
makes the leaves green
a jug
watered stripe
chairs, blanket
or coat and hat are
grass
underclothing
the window panes
are bulletins beside
portraits
which navigate walls
