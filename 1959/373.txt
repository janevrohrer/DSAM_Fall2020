â™¦for Francis Fergusson#
tra color, in sospesi
but where should I go? the
whole world is a bed
up and down
("in the same dress
wings fluttering up near the
beginning of rain
I like to see
the pink car wet
wheels matched by a pool
the rain
muddy in sound
imagine it tipped
besides what it is both
semicircles
steep the gutter
the light water
as much as you look to see
houses which are the same
double barrel
the passion for cars gone
the present as quick as showers
and the past
fallen
a rainbow maybe
somewhat behind trees
enough years
