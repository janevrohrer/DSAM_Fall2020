the dark swimmers
their heads in the sun
If time shd stand still
you can't see it move
which way does the river go
partially the
wind, and light, Down waves
the indefinite flooring
the toppled clouds
the squared mountain

I have felt it as they've said
there is nothing to say
there is everything to speak of
but the words are words
when you speak that is a sound
What have you done, when you have spoken
of nothing
or something 1 will remember
After trying my animal noise
i break out with a man's cry

The fountain of youth is a poetry
and whether we are one minute older
the present always arrives
come as we make it
According to our healths
(when we are sitting still)
but time itself kills
the brush, consumed or not
and the individual
which is needed) dies
necessities dying out
but nothing ends
as everything begins
