The motion appearing the plan will become
definite, as a tree, with different ways,
so many pores, not a wall
angles or shelves with
inscrutables hidden, but
not covered
a roof moving in fragments, then,
impenetrable ceiling, something at last
behind any tangible
bark
so different from a mirror's back
or, as some say, women's eyes
Or, where does skin come from?
the weaving of fish in half-light
Frankly, the best we can grasp is half
(Make possibilities out of time)
Take true conventions: how are they made?
January 52-1965
In this case
Two quick explosions of the body
cause of irruption of blood
as if a signal for a gun
but everything was as before
Cross country trying to save yourself
asleep you don't know Cross country
to kill a summer and
climb mountains
watch the bays
Milestone, a cardinal in a red hat
shooting grouse, an old man
ploughing
mass of night, stars off the dark
autumn is awake
life being unnecessary
Without life, death would be nothing
