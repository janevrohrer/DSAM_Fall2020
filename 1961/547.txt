smells like heavy industry if you go
out to the road
motor flying parts
die
with your cross eye
be the convertible look
up under the trees
blur to make birds fast
ahead compound shape
letters in my chest
the sudden freshness of
cemetery gates
you imagine anything
the heights of
woman
stone
burial up to the branches
sharp bushes, some oak grows
What is
planting canoes
The lake holding
all that noon the whole way
Night is the same season
star off to a slight haze
the clouds
faces on and like hills
move with us
flowers it says spread
the sky to the window
stain
downward how each house
is burning
slopes infringe you
a sign begins
the day's lip
greyhound
or the tramp of grass
a truck brings cows to the restaurant
way off the road indoor
pool
flattened by the walls
man driving in a
horse that's a cloud tossing
and frozen
speechless
