Great Grandma
Her mind, her body's fading now
her life's so dim, so slow.
But when our children's children
come to romp and play about.
The glow that lights our mother's face
is wondrous to behold.
How all the ninety years between
just seem to disappear.
She's oh so young, so gay again
Her Life's so new so bold.
