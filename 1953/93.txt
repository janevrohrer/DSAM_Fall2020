Be with Me
(slowly dying >
Beauty is immortal
But it doesn't have to be
Now what about my chortle,
which is more complicated.
I'm getting stuck.
All I know is
Look at that muck,
rising, rising,
I'd better jump.
Look at all the dark
On over the wall.
It's wonderful you're not blind
when it's barely there at all
Turn to the Hall
Rather than the night sky.
It looks bigger
Appreciably
You should hit the mark
With so much light
or out f 6vÂ©n
Up one flight
I mean or need to be stark.
So do you, really.
Beauty must be familiar
And it should be eely.
All things are more or less beautiful
If we'd be somewhat at ease.
There are ants in my plants
And oils in the seas
