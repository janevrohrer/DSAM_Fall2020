space
music the
thought
easy, the trees
dip rain
vault/through the ear
of a dull year
shortness of the past
the birds dirty living
however feels
clean reflection
the present and future mull
clouds
background
of stars and hills
continuing leaves
hard in the deep well
what's unheard of the distance
flutter, twist on the air
and the wave tides
