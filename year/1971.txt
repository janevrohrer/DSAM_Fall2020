time's
long enough you
remember
you thought it was
as it is

Music is human in the event
the sea curves
(drag light
in the earth
the great sea is orchestrated with men
the wind and the waves
oil slicks

trees stand
dead or alive
branches in
all its gradations
winter pass off
again big
round on the roof
long feet gulls
when they fly they cry
thought flap

some million a million
people suffer the end

Beyond pages
to have things whole
There are millions

less fish in the sea
it still roars
To be is involved

trying to see
what do you see

reflect
world corners
mountains ride
and wind among branches
leaves
different lengths
a wave bends
moments
what purpose
sights
sounds
visions
the earth goes round

A full life
taken little by little
not all at once
you gain time
the pieces wholes
