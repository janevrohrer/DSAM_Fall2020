In the depths of the street
shadow of the day
winded, the steady trees
gathering lands
now they have hands, islands
like a storm's lanes
things that have happened
or might, shifting, there's the drift dream
another place heads
from the sea
picking their way over, the idle
blown aware, parade
to the future , sharp dawn
scythe in, a grist, winter
on a cool floor round again
could these be different
pales? same thing, piled up
a bloody shoal, let darkness
go down, a mist
back through trees
inchoate, the gestures appear
nothing else, where they hide shade
night's
clarity
