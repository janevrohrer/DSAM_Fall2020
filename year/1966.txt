some lines I don't understand
to raise the walls like a curtain
the barking dog has the land to itself
the sleepers are all shut in
pictured California on
the back of doors the kitchen
not lived in
a plane is aboard the wind
level
mountains space
the distance
interesting folds

twist
it
come
off the
tree
top the
poem

almost falling into the picture turned
on shut
off the clock struck
the table reflected
dishes, the other side candy, seats
Which movie?
uncertain limits
of the simultaneous
I own this box
a swerve on the highway years
have become skies
the elevator, inside
up and down
the car window
mountain garage
in a block, this
cubed shelf on which
the ultimate building floats
outside and inside rooms
of any purpose counted
by any names, the cool
assumptions, the twists
of adventure and mystery
among suave walls, the scenes
into the night, the lives
behind the actors put
the face on
you're not rushed
you've attained the sinister
what's this all about
one spring day
the neighbors are whole 

Whitman’s cry at starvation
in a land of plenty
prison camps the mean
South
six ways
of saying it
the big problem is
consumption and conservation and population
population consumption conservation

population conservation consumption
or what about
bringing others in

I could have watched for a week
the able horsemen
with no nonsense
put the sick with the strong
eighty thousand to a hundred thousand
of the wounded and sick
critical cases
I generally watched all night
was with many from the
border states
bedded down
in the openwork of
branches and stars
must not and
should not be
written perhaps
marrow of the tragedy
one vast central hospital
with fighting on the flanges in
the flesh—
how much of importance is
buried in the grave
in eternal darkness

damp
wind
the birds chorusing
clouds moving the sky
the haze
blast the foghorn
through the trees

car going in shape
a modern junk-heap exterior
time taken up math
mach mach I hear
a communication
the bird sounds watery
letting enough things pass
thin/thick going up in fog

a long tongue the kite
to lick the clouds gods of the sky to
reveal to,people are thirsty
night day
in the Chinese playground
how many fires
on earth
whirling eyes

bright moon sky
the city darkens
lights up
where are we going
the cars
oscillate
the clouds
way over
round bobbing
visible change was
at our speed
we have the direction
or the manage of the wind
surfaces
the heights deep
outside
some light is the fog sea

clock ticks
that horn's stuck down
the street
there's less traffic
grow the continuous
like glass besides
palings and air
there are
the parts of a city say where
alleys are shut blind
clouds really fast
the distant fades or
is
idea
there are random visions in sleep

the washer
spins the head off quick
dry
the near vacuum
while the wind blows
on cloud
as much as rock
time so moving
centuries
are in the mind
the ridges scarred
stone
builds
and veins from mountains
man
whole does it
for himself
crumbles to earth
clothes
fresh airing

among various hills
parallels
verticals
wires straight light
past
the church, building
the words, gathering traffic through
goods windows
store banks massing
to the side, large
back of you
green grown up the air
crooked the
end of the street 

Like measuring light
speed while the wind types
nothing, the rain flung cloud fast
huge, the motion, world
flash of the towers
the street rolled
on the hill , past other slopes
building forms odd lots
the bridge once swayed
by its direction the wind twisting
the cloud flow what land
is a city surfaces pile flowers
or parks in crannies with
traffic distance through the hills
sun widening the earth
part of which light a
quiet chance total
moving
an hour now
is clouds they're
over
the whole place
are level

Huge hill, so much
to lie under
life burying you
or overlooks you
field
the view diminishes
you come down
a hole in the wall
brings quiet the
water flows
through pipes there as
the sun might burn leaves through
clouds slope
around the earth
monsters are quiet
the tree shapes
singed spots
black through the centuries
twisting towards the light
they grow familiar cross
each other
a skyway lanes
channel dug out
from a river of sap
or a log
never floated
what time
is day
and night changes
in the weather
the asphalt road
calcine a way off
moon
out by
afternoon
then spreading its light
in the wind the cold fountain

Where / when
the transition made
the various wind
with the streets
hills they ride
as cloud shaped on
visible tides
cars, busses
earth transmits
inside one another
anything's a pile
there are times gears scream
and the sun dims the
clock wall
minus numbers
the station goes
up still
into dark
the regular

quiet
as a bird
the sky fades
the stars out
all this time
air through
the houses
a dog is barking
should there be memory
the moon wanes too
to some appearance

copter over at
the zenith
whirring sun
and how there's been sleep
in all this wind
eyelids from it, dream
maybe there goes
one of these pigeons from the
ground
something
the steady sea
thoughtless
as daylight
shifts grass makes
the earth green
year bounds on year
September
the paint smelling
from next door
fresh tenancy
an empty flat
white
the ceiling lower
the branches
massed by leaves you see the
open
windows
now
men's voices
double-sashed a while
part way
clouds clear in the sun
or lifted weights
birds fly around

happiness from the year
(1820 or so)
end of life what
would you like to know
the nature
of wants
a cloud
all one over
a few big trees
the whole sky
whatever put
time in your mind
water or light
at various temperatures it
rained down
a substance or
gradations
your body stretched
now there's a long tail
balanced along the wire
you take a dinosaur
pink thing
ants
spread all over the lot
extensive number
for the first time in my life
i see a bird
sit on a phonepole nail
trees weed clouds
their due

gulls
crickets
chimneys
trees
dirt in the cellar
smoke clearing the branches

naturally
man
is
gregarious
i see
the houses
pulled
nailed
together
the air towards the sky
gets thinner and thinner
branch turn
waves on the surface
the deep pulses
