the bird
of wire like a nest
IS all through the air
still, minutely
simple
dead in its way, the material
take in the eyes, time
we can waste on a piece ef
While hours may tick by
you remember from childhood
a bird
depending on the weather
flight was a brief
impenetrable keen breast
doubling lives
sleep peace in various light
the lark a little f further beyond
the countryside
