The leaves and the wind
fingers
up in the eyes
of snide
people
the imagination so stalled
at their cars
going to bed
far somewhere down
some purpose
I know what
it is I know
some mass always
in back of them
fine spaces twigs
more broken in the dust
from roots amorphous
spring scattered back
and a cat coming
forward directly
towards them
at the side the
bones inside the fur
clouds trail
enormously the
penetrable hill s
pstticular clockwise
edges of stars at
night
