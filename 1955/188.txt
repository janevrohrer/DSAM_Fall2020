THESE CHILDREN ARE GETTING RESTLESS
My foot hurts, the skin
elsewhere
People have a habit of their aches and pains
themselves
people,around here
I and my brother are becoming twins
and we step on the starter and bypass that
underpass
there are pains it is no use
I canâ€™t sleep it off
the flood
the beach , the chair , my flat
hurts, my
toes plain in the
humid wind, my
shoes are comfortable
