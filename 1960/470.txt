five nursemaids
for three kids
something i can't fathom
the clouds rolled
like tempora
fifteen causes
there's a wind in the tree
all may be blunt a leaf
falls although it is spring
the plane sounds protective
suddenly out of it
pillow
the surge across
wastes sleep
delicious apples
the print
of the screen
in dawn
mesh
still white
like memory
