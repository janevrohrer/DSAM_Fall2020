STAY DOWN
Too much too little opening
some days you wake up and say this is hell, it's too thick
Everything outside is empty
That's morning, an isolated time
you don't even get out of bed
while the big pipe goes in up the street
but the room's there
despite the invisible
(twigs by the window in the next block
I thought there were things in the radio
like the tools in grandmother's attic
thank god there wasn't furniture
Then the houses I used to bare my feet
the perch overhead around the corner
the cigar in the toilet
the gutter oaken from last night's rain
the birds around the corner somewhere
the piano's dust in the other window
sometime they might have been under his hedge
The window
bathroom reflection sky
the trout rocking the lake
with no color but sound
before it leaves in the stream dance
roofs only with branches
cars wait
the long folds
plane
at night on the road
downtown before glasses
making it still narrow
runless lines
build up
drives
bushes at the pot old corners
the ground to the sagged wood rough
drifts fanning the endless stones
the squares part up the
gears
hill
-looking
for the quiet police
the basement station
archives
loan detectives
the clothes don't move in the air
heading the alleyways
or above the neighbor garage
sand suits
no wind in there
facing the other room
