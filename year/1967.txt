things
stirring
together
the wind
fly
objects
birds, shove
out
thermals

cracked blue wall
pipe
water shakes
rising
planes muffle
soar vault
surfaces with time
blasts of sound
move some air
densities amount spreads
the sun courses
water goes round

how
are things
trees
without leaves still
wrapped cool
a sparrow
on the dwindling snowbank
the interval
of winter
maybe
another chirps

light walls the
shape of a window
or more blurred
the street
outdoors
grazed a long
hot cold with
smoke in mouth
ice
where the sun shines
varies
heavier air
or light
minute song
may imply leaves
a few clouds
milling this day
houses
are more shadow
the cut blaze
turn back such heat
darkness to ripple
the line of spring
immediate
the sea's dance


bird skate
air, plow
tree

The snow
bank
melts
and by chance it is
a caved shore
a river bank
white gulls come near
at reduced speed
flap through the
trees just past
the house appear
so
they live once
the egg starts
cloud, moving and none
can stay put and
be warm inside too long
time lost
life as cloud
turned down past horizons rain
shine allowing
the sun through
variously the light
and warmth
always somewhere or as long
as we must think but birds
must add their heat
to the egg and so
sit brooding the sun
if little enough wet
is in the sky clears
the snow
it's when the glare has stopped
and the trees begin more shadow
to hide some birds for a while
singing unseen
though they may do it on wires
just as soon, where
the air is the same
and they move free
gulls lining up
facing the wind from the sea
beautiful behinds
from flight
the snow like the sun to stare at

Head full
of birds the languages
of the world
switching the scenery the same
old things
a crow momentary
thicknesses of the air
are hills shadows
below waver
some clearness now these trees
level the lawn
across the street
the sun there
shift the world up out
whistle in snow

What di
mension line
school busses
come
various size
up the street
vehicles
here the future is
turning the field
the uses
of grain
the birds' need
almost to feed as they fly
I ! burning while asleep
through sun
branching
cloud
shadowy
door
the children grow
wing there the
I shape
' of the whole trees the
present
magnetic back of the vane
the air stars
-a wind- forwards
past
what directions
leaves dis
place
where the sun wanes
winter
numbers
songs
concerns
narrowed eyes time you
air ripples from sun
arrows
boards
the crossroads
goods
the deeps face
the skies

the dying man's car
the big motor
He watches the Grand Prix
He thinks the world is perverted

something to say or
listen to the roar
displacements it's night

a poem is a
characteristic
length of time

dirty work
if you don't give it up
if you don't play games
birds flutter
change to the branches
or thrust and glide
wings closed
the sea moves on the wind
winking
air headlights
sudden legs crouched off
death a million holes
a game used to be washing
contact with light
constant water
conductors sing at rehearsal
lip
and hand
instrument
beautiful breath
a waste into time
the bus steams
a day in the clouds
far enough
if you go slow
this dumpy girl
the black freight cars
the hungry for
games
and games
fragment
bomb

the whole earth together
dirt
controls
clouds
holding up air
water flows
a surface bent in
as made
the moon rocky
cast
at length
salt washed down
what to think or
not to think
buttons
flying
the folks back
like your own neck as
cold as past that wall
to smash the
head
on out
on the tree for you
years turn stone
it's geology
Death
should be as fast
as 2 words
bullets flash
askant your miles

jewelry cored earth stars
waters
over light rock
distance slows bombs
such places that
inevitably burst
in the directions opened where
you set yourself
the firmly felt the swing
the acceptance, dance
earth matching the sky
stretched away
the flamed cave you can't see
such thicknesses
till the woods fuse
till they burn red
the wonder of moments
ah what when
they pass with
each other
fade where they are
fast slow
blue green ... the
jungle
with its laws
past the trees the brush
the branched turned
beasts the mined

a girder a
building
earth and sky
motion clouds
you see
it
look closer there a dark day
dull fires they
"roll"their own take
the corners
red bright flame the dead
picture
something
flashed out
a cat's paw
black as the sea
can be star
dust burns
up
what eyes for the spectrum it's
enough ours

the strength of a wing
a bird hits
the front door
ah glass
and the wind flows
stripped metal
brightness of sun
a change spreads in the air 

how many languages how many languages how many languages my
mind changed
the efficacy of words
member of earth and air
maple or pine a
being a cat
ambled width of the road
ducks under
the big car
shadows thrusts in the wind
facing another
snout to snout
the sunlight in the fur
depth riding some puddle
birds sit
with trees
what are
the hairs
riffling
back to the tail
3 bulbs burn down the hall
through the front door

massing goods and swarming people
The apples we take in
and
a few leaves left

Strength feels
babies how
unconscious we are startling
big men on the way
they run they
can't walk far decline
the mountain grass just look at
stars knock-outs
how slow is the distance
the graves
the strong green
complicated productions
the loudspeaker from the field
covers the street
the phone seemed too simple
the old man's idea
he wants to go there
cutting the grass with gas
leaves rising and falling
in what winds

the disappearance of matter
where is the
end of a poem
tired eyes
the sun travels
and allows dream

” I was glad that my missile had
been thrown away "
— Lord Jim ch.9
mirrors scattered
you lie down
the sky is clear
or the dark various an
event in your eye
the winds come to your ear
how small each
arrow what rooms pumped
with sound may be
shut lids
beyond floors
birds sleep in the bush

S. Thomas More said
Tarry while I
put aside my beard it
has not committed treason
canonized 1935
up at the City Gates
the dreamer's face
invisible

garages
predicaments
hangars
tree-huts
something about the Japanese
all the upholstery on man
know how to sit
an empty room
surrounded by thoughts
the walls hold shadow from night
openings
jet
prop
the sky
the sunlight cross roofs, fields, a
familiar thing

from the Chinese laundry
mat lot
on the east coast
brown leaves
Hallowe'en
wan dead tooth there's
indifference
the old people themselves

the street
plastered with leaves
let' s
actually twist
the shapes made real

Silence!
except for the
cold storage motor
the oil burner
the clock
and the big plane
briefly, somewhere
any size its end
now there's
a morning
sparrows eat seeds
the energy
to push air

how many is one I
scour the
countryside
nebulous
front of me
a happy wave
the plow
polarized
cool here

that's all figures
the car volume more sun
a gull coasting
the porch
going along alone
straight roads
poles march
name gradations
the skies far no angle
above the signs
or how many that make
the maximum
what lights are there
before stars
to think all the time
spokes
these fumes
it ’ s
mirrors that tilt
things
the curb round fender
hard now immobile lids
inside down and outside up
morning whole cat poring the cup
the gray sea what seasons

those shades are from trees
a bird from the clothesreel
a yellow / leaf
thing is ours
back yard
changes of view
nothing we say flat
the wind
the railroad tracks
harsh silhouette
the moon’s eye train
half complete steps in
vanishing cloud

There is no community
he goes to
Work mornings
the motor fades sway the
numberless towns

the ol man steps
at 2 a.m.
wind cloaks the house
it's no matter
blown hard what times the
snow flying
down headlong
rests
not much 

milk of earth a well
water stars
a wind to breathe
hidden years by the window
smell of rain
the light wavers
and air
winding to silence ears
far vibrations the mouth
reception the plane shakes
Iceland wood
Canada stone
a fine brown sparrow
or some few leaves hung
paired dust
