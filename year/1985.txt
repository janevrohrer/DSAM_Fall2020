down the block
so many places
large and small
to come at you
how long
can a dumptruck be
broad level streets
have wide-open corners
in the wind
steep the trees lean
from back yards rising
dappled sky

train
going by
bedroom
dinette
kitchen
whistle
aside from
cars
stop and start
by poles
birds and trees
cats dogs and Squirrels

walnut walnut loquat
love what tree
a squirrel every day
against level hills

clouds
windy
street
below the hills
a uniformed man
on the way
bound for somewhere

tdamping down
a volcano with
a good amount
of seawater
so iceland
is an island
geothermal
bathbubs
how many
days
firemen
from the university
of the capital
none of it
a sure thing

end History about like
any other point
the line between
"psychic numbing" and
sense enough to knock you flat
getting thinner and thinner I think
vanished a while back
whatever you want in sight
( Geographic
doesnâ€™t right now blink
chemical dumps
a battlefield

Sunday
plane
faraway
is peace
a crowd
inside
provisioned
veers right
it comes closer
faster

Death th is
great
impediment
of all
time
pain exhausted
at what moments
building up
one by one
into what mass
to equal sand and stars

one of two nickels
a fly walking the rim
makes it flicker, shine

a big oblong box
a goodwill truck
realizes space
whatever's inside

a little
real oblivious bird
taking a few drinks
on the sidewalk
reflecting the deep blue sky

"riding/ the clouds of his belief
Chagall
in flight before sputnik mother kept him going though never
mind pain/ting she said baking all the bread warm as blake
keats as 1 day he was born was the sun shining because of
roan 2 or 3 centuries odd enough how much Earth might heat
say people, cats walking the roofs the streets snowy up to
number 9 before and after the bomb till death must come your
eyes peered open for love some sharp and blurred faces

Intimations
child in the drive blue
sky blank
ages
12 million years in the mind
as much as next week
and at some point the sun
will gulp up the whole earth

farther past now
thinking a
few scraps
fragments like
the shadows cast on the wall
from cars slow
through the street before dawn
the way to work and
back
smokes smells
cloud tree sky
product
and by-product
something you've cared about
went to sleep
and forgot about it
whatever worth

motorcyclists 1
a dozen blocks
roaring like that
two by two
planes
crisscross
later
the jets up high
bolt
sheet
lightning

rustle
emptiness
a car goes through
there's a fence on the corner
clouds moving away
south
streetlight
in the sun
4 birds
into the tree
others sway to the wind
a steep wall
above roofs
tracks to the back
globe of the moon
the cat wary along by the flue
sound disappears
down the block

big
big
big
big
grab whole

Your garden
a small place
on the earth
outdoors
however it goes
whatever storms
whatever is stilled
one season and another
On receiving from
James Weil his
Houses Roses 4

my own thoughts and visions then
I wake up to
moonlight like
snow in the street
so long ago at last
