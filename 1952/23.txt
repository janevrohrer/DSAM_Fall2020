no chair tipped over
Cherry Orchard
The stage, a former playroom
had sunny, afternoon windows
in a white past,
budding and childish
and doors busy
things,taking their places
people laughing and stalling
as they finally had to move
An old man lying down
My grandfather emigrated
the same day
others achieving
control of every thing
the stage is black and white
The stage looms forward,
minus the slave, the orchard
the noble kitchen
