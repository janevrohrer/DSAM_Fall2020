If you weep, I think that
others might cry
though it is no matter The rain
is more fruitful
to the earth breaking
heavy with birds
and leaves we could
not hold I
you push
and the fog
shadowing tides
filling the
island, farther
out dampering it down
until the wet congeals
everywhere in the great
arches
for which our sight even
becomes too thin, weed
sand and stone, and the tolerant subdued cats
the sea, the sun
arching beyond
everything there is
here and the birds' scream
hunger or puff
to the silencing light
and the eyes open
again, at the
blind rain
in fear and removal
you cough and it is
not the same
