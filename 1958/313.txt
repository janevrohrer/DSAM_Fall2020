Partition
For the poor without money
Four houses are always open
The hospital or the prison
The church or the cemetery...
From the dust in the road
I weave you verses
Not one is over
But I take up another.
Look at what the proverb says,
Don't believe all you see
by itself!
Who is right and who is wrong?
Imagine!
The world is a lie
Nothing is truer than death.
Women like the first stones
Boats and buildings on the same lines
If one thing gives
Everything is wound up!
Even the wood from the mountains
Undergoes treatment,
Either the big saints
Or the small coals.
If it's only to be born once
If it's only to love one time
If it's just to live one time
If it's only to die without noise!
