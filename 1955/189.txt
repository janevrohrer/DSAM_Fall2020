A Sleep
air is mild, not quite
bareness, the sky
the Clouds are nothing
the rain
is tremendous it is mild
dispersing
figures
the ocean day
break the gulls
manage the view
a year ago here was a hurricane
to stay in one place
at evening
to move about
the morning pass
the gnomes stop their shaking
and convert into flowers
o laugh
some, visible
dissipating seeds
to find more endings as a tree or circle
one state contemplates others
and we have gone in towards death
leaving, up, the
filled birds to the sea
