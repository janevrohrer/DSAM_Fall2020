Night for a change
Outside the window the house
was bare, like ours maybe
nextdoor) then all up the road
within we were half naked, the
sides naked
a different matter
may they never wrinkle or bloom
and crash
the upper dimension light
a white rain from evening
clouds
perhaps the second of invisibility's gathering
to go nowhere
let pass
If it increases, tomorrow the ground
may be wet and stick
I will not forget the flowers
in the fields which
still lead one to
another walls
though June has been like autumn
a schoolboy sprawls in the
strange bed above
the fixture, and in the middle of the room
let alone the sun
the sky isn't to be
soon childhood
simple enough, spreads on the corners
while the holly bushes wave
in the breeze or the tulips dance
moments
against the yard as the
cat has been edging through
