Passing off
the bus at the clock
the schoolchilcirÂ©n
he walks away
down the street where
they grew up
in some hours
the wind blows
at the other street they've
painting for months
Sundays ladders
apply behind the open rails
the sun reflects
above on the windows
the porch chairs
the snow not less familiar now
the year round
time for the
cold to creep in
even if the sleds
were not fewer
the fire whistle
at a turn of the head
and the birds some
in the mind
the trees are just the
same age
yet free of that light
morning and afternoon
the hardened lines in
repetitions
underneath
the shade and invisible
momentary sounds
even the bare branches
flood, the beaten continuous
source behind and further
against the field or like a surf
whether you're there or not
the manifest and ghastly
making a difference
while they wait
the houses that might as well move
or might have, it's the same
he goes by
at a steady pace
the nights simple
but maybe as long
