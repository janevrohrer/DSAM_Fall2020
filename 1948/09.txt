Cloud Sculptures
Dim shapes in clouds that have no form.
Casting light shadows on the ground.
Move, as the winds that have no sound,
As if they had some destination.
Expressions of the wind they are, I know--
Shaped only when the days are bright and warm.
Yet somehow, when they come, and when they go,
I wonder if they have no hidden meaning.
Clouds that catch the evening light
From the setting sun,
Tell us some fantastic tale.
When our work is done.
Show us what the earth was like
When castle walls were high;
Then blend into a starry night
Of distant nebulae.
