For Sleep
I depend on the stars
and the places of night
This is what it is
intent space, and
the speed which is light, growing
past any shape
the half-door or the door
slightly open
this is what happens when I move
(or I see motion, all of it
I'm in it
the world depopulated
those configurations of spirits
scattered and gone
so to disappear
the side of this road
nothing
I want room
