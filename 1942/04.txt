Change In Our Town
The buttercups in our town.
Are as in Springs before.
And the wintry winds in our town.
Still pound upon the door.
But the birds fly high by our town.
They come by night and by day.
The birds roar low o'er our town.
The birds are on their way!
The lamps are low in our town.
The streets are wrapped in gloom.
The only lights in our town.
Are the stars and the pale, cold moon.
There are sleepless nights in our town
In factory and in mill.
The once long hours in our town.
Are growing shorter still.
We're working hard in our town.
We're working to procure
A new town, a better town,
A town awakeâ€”secure.
We've made mistakes in our town.
Mistakes that brought this night.
But another chance in our town
And we will set things right.
