those crooked houses
the way standing
the sky packs clouds, mute
like summer ice
stream of trees
wreathing to the ear
a bird in
the porch and over
the next roof
by
the least curve
tangent
as beyond a nest a
Window
edge-piece
steepened leaves
bhe clouds were not 
hulls hurrying
a sure place 
blue and now
anything might wait
over the line
and now
a little to the side 
it's like the zenith
that purple of 
stars the sun as slow
