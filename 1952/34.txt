Before there were planes I don't think
the clouds looked solid now
I know that
but shadings, and above
light nacelles, V-heads, stones
riding at the sides of their wings
which sweep forewards, their own shapes
map of gyros and screws
explode someday
dreadnaught
I like to skim
push the cape in
around me a plane
unseen
oi' a legless cat
attaching from its back
but that complete power breaks off
changing its course an inch
after nothing in the sky
