I
I can only play one note at a time
(and I've got ten fingers) This is the piano
and I should think of something I have to
play
and have to vary without looking
from precision of simple things
barn
with only that and
the tune in my mind

"Keep at it," they say when they see L.
reading, then disappear down the front steps
and plenty die, playing the black market
a heart attack in middle age

in the blackout
waiting for death, wanting sleep
and the walls had nothing more to reflect
world
the sea
a shock wave
and fliers a mile away
were planes of another country
Afterwards the sun came around
and they say how
stars will collide

O p e n
They nod at me and I at stems
Yes, I agree But I flower myself,
or can't change
Yes, passes. As I,pass on the air
As i, pause
As i dream, sight
I have been on all sides
my face and my back
Disappears any time a world can
Reality dissolve
abstract, abstract, O little
seeing that word
blue against the stackâ€”
o i walk i walk
the pavements
assume they are yellow
the flowers seem to nod
