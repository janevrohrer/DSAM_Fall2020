♦ On hearing Fred Whipple, in a panel
discussion at Brandeis, advance the
idea that "a good part" of mankind
will eventually remove to outer space,
because of radiation ♦
Weather hi-fi.
Forest Lawn in the sky
A diaper-service and all
to make everything natural,
normal, healthy and free
in Eternity, Infinity
Sublime at the ultimate speed
to which the missile could lead.
You don't die and you never sleep.
Should you ever feel like sheep
you just pull up a Universe History
to get more sense of the mystery,
the only calculable course
between artificial planets provided by the arcane force,
consistence you modulate without ever getting terse
or immersed.
Man with his meaning has overtaken the stars.
But where does he park his bicycles, multiple airlines, or cars?
Anyway, the Red Shift is about to be
in domestic frequency;
and why should you be psychotic
when you don't take any anti-biotic
and you're completely beyond demotic;
then it's enough to make you another Joule,
the blue sight of a swimming-pool.
The A-tests make it logical
But go ask the Zulus if it's anthropological.
