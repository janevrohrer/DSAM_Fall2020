FOR THE LONG SEASON
I heard the crickets seething like machines
October may
the winter never come
the birds
now in my age that the sky is timeless
let there be no time
and the blue go down among the branches
under the bark green
If that is possible
or let it pass
out of me
morning.
no
FOR THE LONG SEASON 2
five pigeons on the rim of the barrels
they are tin and so rattle
and it takes two seconds to get
on the other side of the street
and there is the air
sound does not travel
for it can't be seen
I hear them from far away
the birds outline the world
the pigeons walk in the air
as we swim
while the leaves are blown
O creatures
critters, we
are the world in the sky
the cats make themselves narrow
going through
