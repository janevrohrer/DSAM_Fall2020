to break up time, as it goes on, and
reorganize, cast back
on memory, may be
coming and going,
even when what is spawned
is death, the blind of an alley
or the end of a twig
It comes to end, then, and coming
and going goes on. But
sound, another matter,
involves no reflection, crosses no doors
comes forward
However, when
we turn our heads for a minute
this time has gotten away .
