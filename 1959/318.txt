The hours, keepers of heaven
time is lost
as they move around and
die, the lunges gods
shout wounds Love, Ares, almost his end
spent "and night come down on"
pine-trees, the hungry mountain
field of a hill
cities like any other
the homes you drive in o weakened ghosts
the airs have no blood, restless, like yourselves
infinite
bones, street by a wall
once they've sailed another
place valuable
kinds ships breathe
bottomless piles while on the destructive
tides
and over where the sky closes in
the light of Dawn from the sea
approach the altars of god
alive with the mounting cloud
and the damp, smell, the heart blood
the idea of
a palace
under the lagoon
and slow motion
that means more
time
only the grey sea
we must talk
if we see the thing
death we have made
or the long run is never finished
hands
of that holy height
a certain number of minutes
some brought him back alive
