Romance
to enter another man
though himself
in his own place far
more than anywhere
a man must stand,
no snake is there
To feel other space
than what you are
deliberate steps
distinct if man
should lose like wind
he doesn't come
like lightning again
Then, where are you? You
reduce to unreal skin
I, knowing
members and having flapped
elbows, imagine wings,
outlines, not tooled hands,
at distance, partly by eye
slightly round and up
holding my lap
