Before setting, the sun on my eyes
the grass at my feet, so silent
the wind blowing, the distance, waning
space
it will be dark and silent
in a nomad country
dank, air
sound to the river
gullies
i walk to see
stars when the sky
takes off into nothing
the fields
turn, waving
forever
occluded, a slow jet
enters, fields are cool
at a distance
the steady lights
halt where the wolves wake up
and cry
and the bulls were shot
