En Sphere
every lightbulb of the coast
shows up the citified world
at anchor like a concave ship
terrace
whose bulk is the last berth with
endless corners when
welded against the sky
These moorings monuments
Behind the orange-crossed bridge
and after that crowd
amusement park
The dark stable beach after
cottage cluster where streets
end open the dark floor
musty inside in back
the sheds
hidden by light
slums, farther plains
beside the office docks
distance stacks and tanks
and one arm people in cars
or foot under
houses face the water
while stores at the Q-tail move
by starred and softened danger
