the fleering snow
off the eaves
of the garage

snow
blinding
cold

bowels
brewing
j'ai 50 ans

for James Sherry
Little finger suddenly
not so small
pretty far
fifty years old
its bone big anyway
life to language
and back and forth
there's the walk to the store
seen through leaves
the corner fitful
wind space branches
snow come a week ago
piled up
empty
sky overhead
or clouds
the sun shining

people
silent
outdoors
the sky clear
day
no wind
distant
how much
clouds
hamburger joint
enough
parking lots
business
food
the moon slight moving

wind huge outside since when
falling asleep alpha rhythms I suppose
â€¢how many years
without death

"No air stirs ..." for LZ
music without burden
the air of heaven
so there's no vacuity there
but level steep
nothing speaks of which
on earth shadows rough
bumps lumps what's
not
mildly put
in hand
clear
day
seeing hearing touch

parking lot but
there are words otherwise
and here's a recording shop
something to eat then
dog with bone
corners at times
buildings sopped by-products
through some range of goods
weird? is
it mystery? enough?
fish in the museum
pavement mosaic
as yet in the river too
far off turned
earth matter blocks brick
your eye sighting level
a city fixed in the ash
likewise come by the air
slender
dream architecture
opening a garden wall
such hundreds of years suddenly
stop pain cut fate
as they've said
1 time there were no roads
(anyplace) and
here these people are

hills
earth
sky
night
clouds

DOWN ON THE BED you
can' t
imagine
enough

silent
bits
speeches

1"
faces
power music
good words
feel how
to do it
perform the
9th

here
the skychanges
shut the eyes
leaves
in motion around

past midnight
in chilly streets how
could a ball
bounce what
sounds like it
