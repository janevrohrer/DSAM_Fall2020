Day Crowd Weather
Life by eating and passing
solid and water
parts are constantly changed
every two springs
different man
How much bigger, for a while bigger
Fall leaves
alternate
Winter and summer, familiar
two main seasons
But scarcely enough
This tree grown for
the phone wires
airy space
between the upright branches and the lower ones
it is scanty and rich too
when I see the branches which yet twist like trails
ride and making room
and yet still standing after all
the sprays that survive me
Heat came
early for some reason
though first it was hot and then it was cold
excitement, and exhaustion, then fog
like mugginess, out of sight but
soaking, then a strong wind
from the south, mind you, which was damp besides
and slammed doors
In the
street quiet like safe buildings an
Africa with rose-bushes and lilies even
flashing color,while above half the opposite
wind
bearing down
an autumn tunnel roaring
On the same day. Each forest
robins at some recesses
shouting or
holding with joy to
rollicking ground
the flat islands float up high
sun beating through wind
the eyes their elements
Starting the place was foreign
still chilly with sleep, what would be
hottest
the time when Romans were at school
and then two children,walked
and schoolbusses for some stretch
we were so fast
surprised, the clock seemed absent
Lately
the usual daytime
at last
now, again
go back, slouch
found
different position
all of a sudden
and feet
under or
lying that way
scene, it might have been magic
roadbed cut dream
this speed not impossible with
wind in the ear, the nostril fan
down the car pulling you,you forward
the car sling out at the corner
the abstract forces
hitherto abstract
Lower and the sky's acts
which somehow is forgotten
something against something
not seen
suggesting all possible continents
that supple country
forgotten
always
wasteless
clouds marks currents each way
